<p class="unindent"><span class="smcap">But</span> as she looked at Nell, Nora saw
a stain of blood showing through the
sleeve of her light print dress.</p>

<p>‘But you msng hurt. You are bleeding!’
she exclaimed with horror. ‘Oh, I <em>am</em>
so sorry. What can I do for you?’</p>

<p>Nell regarded the blood-stain with calm
indifference.</p>

<p>‘It is nothing, my lady. I presume I
am speaking to Lady Bowmant,’ she
added, with a courtesy that struck Nora
as uncommon with her class.</p>

<p>‘Oh, no, I am not Lady Bowmant.
I am only one of her visitors. I was
driving with her, and she went into a<span class="pagenum" id="Page_2">[Pg 2]</span>
cottage and left me with the carriage, and
these two little brutes ran away with me.
But how am I to get them home? I
dare not take the reins again for my life.
How far is it to the Hall?’</p>

<p>‘Oh, the Hall is only round the corner,
madam,’ answered Nell; ‘I would help
you to lead them, but—’ Here she hesitated,
not knowing how to proceed; then,
as if a sudden thought had struck her,
she stood on tip-toe and looked over the
hedge and called loudly, ‘Tom.’</p>

<p>‘Yes, miss,’ replied a hedger coming
at her call.</p>

<p>‘Come round here at once and lead
these horses up to the Hall for this lady.
They are beyond her control.’ Then
addressing Nora, she continued—‘You had
better get in again, madam, and this man
will see you safely to the Hall. You will
want to send the carriage back for Lady
Bowmant.’</p>

<p>‘Oh, yes, indeed. What will she think
of my disappearing in this extraordinary
manner? Thank you so much. I don’t<span class="pagenum" id="Page_3">[Pg 3]</span>
know what I should have done without your
assistance. But I am so troubled about
your arm. I am sure you are horribly hurt,’
said Nora, as she mounted into the dog-cart.</p>

<p>‘Please don’t say anything more about
it,’ replied Nell; ‘at the worst it will only
be a bruise; you need not be afraid
now, madam. This man is rough, but
he understands horses, and is very steady.’</p>

<p>And so saying Nell slipped through a
break in the hedge and was gone.</p>

<p>Lady Ilfracombe arrived safely at the
Hall, and a groom was at once despatched
to pick up Lady Bowmant, whom he met
half-way between old Farley’s cottage and
the house, laughing heartily to herself over
the disappearance of her friend and her
carriage, having made a shrewd guess that
Beau and Belle had taken her home,
whether she would or not. The occurrence
formed the chief topic of conversation at
the luncheon-table, and Nora was full of
the beautiful country girl she had met
and who had shown so much courage in
stopping the runaway cobs.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_4">[Pg 4]</span></p>

<p>‘I must make her some little acknowledgment
of the service she rendered
me, mustn’t I, Ilfracombe?’ she asked
her husband. ‘I might have been killed,
if it hadn’t been for her, and, or still worse,
smashed Lady Bowmant’s pretty trap.’</p>

<p>‘Of course you must, darling,’ replied
the earl. ‘We can never repay her for
what she did for us.’</p>

<p>‘But I don’t know her name!’ exclaimed
Nora, ‘though I suppose she lives somewhere
over the way, because she ordered
the old hedger to lead the cobs home, as
if he were her servant. Oh, she is such
a pretty young woman. Her face is perfectly
lovely. I think it was because I
was so occupied gazing at her, that I
forgot to ask her name.’</p>

<p>‘A very pretty girl,’ repeated Sir
Archibald. ‘I think that must be one
of the Llewellyns. They’re the prettiest
girls for a good many miles round Usk.
Isn’t that the case, Dolly?’ he said, addressing
his wife.</p>

<p>‘Well, I’ve only seen the married one,’ she<span class="pagenum" id="Page_5">[Pg 5]</span>
replied, but I know they bear that reputation.
The father is a very handsome old man.’</p>

<p>At the name of Llewellyn, Lady Ilfracombe
looked up quickly, and the earl
and Jack Portland exchanged glances with
each other.</p>

<p>‘What is there in that to surprise you?’
demanded their host, mistaking the meaning
of their looks. ‘Wales is rather celebrated
for beauty, you know; at least
we won’t allow that England, Ireland or
Scotland can hold a candle to us in that
respect.’</p>

<p>Ilfracombe did not seem disposed to
answer, so Jack Portland took upon himself
to be spokesman.</p>

<p>‘I have not the slightest doubt of your
superiority, Sir Archibald,’ he said, ‘and
was not the least surprised to hear you
say so. I only thought I had heard the
name before.’</p>

<p>‘What! of Llewellyn? <em>I</em> should be
surprised if you had not. We are all
Llewellyns, or Owens, or Lewises, or
Thomases in Wales. It’s one of the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_6">[Pg 6]</span>
commonest names here. I’ve about half
a dozen Llewellyns amongst my tenants.
But this man’s daughters are really uncommonly
handsome. Fine tall girls, with
splendidly cut features. By Jove! it’s a
pleasure to go to the farm only to catch
a glimpse of one of them.’</p>

<p>‘And that’s why you’re always going
over there then,’ cried Lady Bowmant.
‘I’ve caught you at last, my gentleman.
No more Panty-cuckoo Farm for you.
I’ll take good care of that.’</p>

<p>‘Panty-cuckoo Farm! Is that where my
rustic beauty lives?’ exclaimed Nora.
‘What a fanciful name! What does it
mean? Panty-cuckoo.’</p>

<p>‘The dell of the cuckoo, or the cuckoo’s
dell,’ replied Lady Bowmant. ‘Yes, isn’t it
pretty? It’s the farm just across the road,
where Mr Portland and Mr Lennox sleep.
Mrs Llewellyn is a dear old woman. I
always go to her in any perplexity. She
supplies us with all the extra eggs and
chickens and butter we may want. Lady
Ilfracombe, you <em>should</em> see her dairy; it’s a<span class="pagenum" id="Page_7">[Pg 7]</span>
perfect picture, and everything about the
farm is so quaint and old, and so faultlessly
clean and neat. She and her husband
are quite model tenants. I always take my
friends to pay them a visit.’</p>

<p>After luncheon, when the rest of the
party had separated to pursue their own
devices, Nora crept after her husband.</p>

<p>‘Ilfracombe,’ she whispered, ‘supposing
this should be one of <em>her</em> sisters?’</p>

<p>‘Whose? What are you talking about?’
he said rather curtly.</p>

<p>‘You know. The Miss Llewellyn you
have told me of.’</p>

<p>‘What will you get into your head next?
What likelihood is there of such a thing?
Who ever said she had any sisters, or
came from Usk? Didn’t you hear Sir
Archibald say the place was peopled with
Llewellyns? Please don’t get any absurd
fancies into your head. The name is distasteful
to me as it is? I wish we had
not heard it. Now, I suppose there will
be a grand fuss made of the service this
girl rendered you, and the whole family<span class="pagenum" id="Page_8">[Pg 8]</span>
will be paraded out for our special benefit.
You have been a good friend to me in
this business, Nora. Get me out of this
unnecessary annoyance, if you can.’</p>

<p>‘Of course, I will,’ replied his wife
readily. ‘You sha’n’t be bothered if I can
help it, Ilfracombe. You were a dear, good
boy to make a clean breast to me of the
matter, and I’ll see you don’t suffer for
it. I must remunerate the young woman
or her parents for what she did this morning,
so I’ll just go to the farm this afternoon
by myself and get it quietly over.
How much should I offer her? What
do you think? Will five pounds be
enough?’</p>

<p>‘I think so; but that is as you feel
about it. But Nora, darling, you needn’t
mention our names, need you? We shall
be gone probably before they have a
chance of finding out anything about us,
and though I don’t suppose there is any
chance of their being related to—to—<em>her</em>—yet
if they should be—you understand?’</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_9">[Pg 9]</span></p>

<p>Lady Ilfracombe went up to her husband
and kissed his anxious face.</p>

<p>‘I understand,’ she replied, and then
left the room. There was a slight summer
shower that afternoon, and the rest
of the Hall party had already settled
themselves to spend it indoors. A noisy
set were occupied in the billiard-room,
chatting and laughing over their game,
and the more respectable scandalmongers
were working, reading, and taking away
their neighbours’ characters in the seclusion
of the drawing-room. Lady Ilfracombe
donned a large straw hat, and,
taking an umbrella in her hand, set forth
for Panty-cuckoo Farm without observation.
She soon found her way through
the white gate, and down the hilly slope,
and found the latched wicket that guarded
the bricked pathway up to the house. As
soon as she placed her hand upon the latch,
Mrs Llewellyn, as was her custom at the
approach of any visitors, came quickly forward
to save her the trouble of opening it, and
give her a welcome to Panty-cuckoo Farm.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_10">[Pg 10]</span></p>

<p>‘Walk in, my lady,’ she exclaimed cordially.
‘This way, if you please,’ and ushering
Nora into the parlour she dusted a
chair with her apron, and set it before her.</p>

<p>‘Oh, what a lovely room,’ cried Nora
enthusiastically, as she gazed around her.
‘What dear old carved oak. Why, it
must be centuries old; and what beautiful
china. Don’t leave me here alone, pray,
or I shall steal half your things. I suppose
you are Mrs Llewellyn. Well, you
have the very jolliest room I ever saw in
my life.’</p>

<p>Mrs Llewellyn was completely won over
by this praise. She was very proud, as
has been said before, of her room and
oak and china, and nothing pleased her
better than to see them appreciated.</p>

<p>‘Many have told me so before, ma’am;
but I am glad you like them. My husband
and I have been offered pounds and
pounds sometimes for these very things
by the ladies and gentlemen who have
visited Usk; but we could never make up
our minds to sell them. They belonged to<span class="pagenum" id="Page_11">[Pg 11]</span>
our great-great-grandparents, and there they
will be till our time comes to leave them
behind us for the benefit of our daughters.’</p>

<p>‘Your daughters, Mrs Llewellyn. That
reminds me of the purpose of my visit
to you. A young woman, whom I believe
to be one of your daughters, did me a
very great service this morning. She
stopped a pair of runaway horses for
me, and saved, perhaps, my life.’</p>

<p>‘Ay, that was my eldest girl. She told
us of it; but it is nothing to make a fuss
about, ma’am. Country girls are more
used to do such things than town ladies.
There’s not a girl in Usk but what would
do her best to stop a horse. I hope you
weren’t hurt at all yourself, ma’am?’</p>

<p>‘Not a bit; but your daughter was.
I saw the blood-stain on the sleeve of
her dress. I am afraid the horse touched
her arm with his hoof when he threw her
down.’</p>

<p>‘It can’t be over much,’ said Mrs
Llewellyn quietly, ‘for she never said anything
to me about it, though now you<span class="pagenum" id="Page_12">[Pg 12]</span>
mention it, ma’am, I <em>did</em> notice a bit of
blood on her sleeve too. Lor’, it’s nothing.
I thought she got it in the henhouse maybe,
or the larder. It isn’t worth speaking of.’</p>

<p>‘But I am quite of a different opinion
I can assure you, Mrs Llewellyn, and I
came over expressly to tell you so. May I
see your daughter? Is she in the house?’</p>

<p>‘Certainly, ma’am, if you wish it. I’ll
send her to you at once, and perhaps you
would do us the honour to take a cup of
tea whilst you wait. Lady Bowmant, she
always has a cup of tea when she comes
here. She says she has quite a fancy for
our cream.’</p>

<p>‘I will with pleasure, Mrs Llewellyn.
Indeed I have heard such grand accounts
of your famous dairy that I am quite
anxious to taste its produce.’</p>

<p>The farmer’s wife bridled under the
compliment, and turned with the intention
of leaving the room; but as she reached
the door she said,—</p>

<p>‘May I take the liberty of asking your
name, madam?’</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_13">[Pg 13]</span></p>

<p>Nora was just about to give her maiden
name, remembering her husband’s injunction,
when she noticed she had withdrawn
the glove of her left hand, and
displaying her wedding-ring and jewelled
keepers, so with her quick wit, which
never found her at a disadvantage, she
borrowed the name of one of the ladies,
who was even at that moment taking
away hers in the Hall drawing-room, and
answered, ‘Mrs Lumley.’</p>

<p>‘Thank you, madam,’ said the old
woman, as she curtseyed and withdrew. In
another moment she was adjuring Nell to
go down to the parlour and hear what
the lady from the Hall had to say to
her.</p>

<p>‘Oh, mother, why did you say I was
indoors?’ she exclaimed fretfully. ‘What
should she want to see me for? You
know how I hate seeing strangers.’</p>

<p>‘Well, my lass, it is not my fault. The
lady, Mrs Lumley is her name, wants to
thank you for what you did this morning,
and for my part I think it is very pretty-mannered<span class="pagenum" id="Page_14">[Pg 14]</span>
of her to come over herself
when she might have written to express
her gratitude. But here she is, and you
must go down and see her whilst I make
her a cup of tea. She says she heard
so much of our dairy that she’s quite
anxious to taste our cream. She’s as nice-spoken
a young lady as ever I met, and
I’m sure she has good intentions towards
you.’</p>

<p>‘But I don’t <em>want</em> to be thanked,’ repeated
Nell in the same tone. ‘It was
the simplest thing in the world; anyone
would have done it. I only caught at the
reins as the horses passed me. What does
she want to make a fuss about it for?
Its over and done with. Why can’t she
leave it alone?’</p>

<p>‘Well, my lass, I can’t stay to answer
all your testy questions. I must go and
see that the kettle boils for the tea.
Now, go down, there’s a good girl. She’s
one of the Hall guests, and we mustn’t
offend them, you know.’</p>

<p>So Nell smoothed her rippling hair, and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_15">[Pg 15]</span>
went down to the parlour with a bad
grace, and stood just inside the door, stiff
as a soldier on duty, and without speaking
a word. But Nora did not seem to
perceive her mood. She thought her stiffness
was meant for respect.</p>

<p>‘Oh, Miss Llewellyn,’ she began, ‘I’ve
come over expressly to see you, and thank
you better than I could this morning for
the great service you rendered me. Don’t
stand there, pray, but come here and sit
down by me, and let me tell you how
brave and courageous and good I think
you were to do so much for a stranger.’</p>

<p>Nell’s haughty shyness was overcome
by the cordiality of her new acquaintance.
She sat down as she was asked to do, but
not a feature of her beautiful face relaxed.
She could not forget that she was speaking
to a visitor from the Hall—that place which
she had so much dreaded since she knew
that Mr Portland was staying there.</p>

<p>‘I can’t see the particular courage of it,
Mrs Lumley,’ she replied. ‘I was sauntering
along inside the hedge looking for some<span class="pagenum" id="Page_16">[Pg 16]</span>
of my mother’s turkey poults that had
strayed from the yard when your horses
came tearing along, and I put out my hand
mechanically to stop them. You are making
too much of my action—indeed you
are. Tom was only a few yards further
on, clipping the hedges. He would have
stopped them, and better than I did, and
not been rolled so ignominiously in the dust,’
and Nell could not help smiling at the
recollection.</p>

<p>‘Ah, and you were kicked or something!’
exclaimed Nora; ‘I saw the blood
on your arm. And yet you will say it
was of no consequence.’</p>

<p>Nell rolled up the sleeve of her print
dress, exposing her white, smooth arm.
There was a long graze on it, and it was
beginning to get discoloured.</p>

<p>‘That is all,’ she said contemptuously.
‘You don’t call <em>that</em> anything.’</p>

<p>‘But indeed I do,’ said Nora; ‘and it
was ever so good of you to incur it for
my sake. Besides, you don’t consider the
risk you ran. Because you happened to<span class="pagenum" id="Page_17">[Pg 17]</span>
get off with a few bruises, it doesn’t follow
that it was not quite as brave of you
to risk getting your leg broken or your head
run over. And there is no saying what
you did not save me from. No, no, Miss
Llewellyn, you shall not put me off that
way. You must let me offer you some
little remuneration for your timely help.
Don’t imagine I think any money can
repay you for it, but perhaps you will buy
yourself some little present to remind you
of this day, and how grateful I am to
you.’</p>

<p>And Nora placed the five-pound note
gently in Nell’s hand as she spoke. Nell
never opened it. It might have been for
fifty pounds for aught she knew, but she
took it up, folded as it was, and replaced
it on her companion’s lap.</p>

<p>‘No, thank you, Mrs Lumley,’ she said
quietly. ‘You mean it kindly, I know,
and I appreciate your intention, but I cannot
take money from you for so slight
a thing. My father would not like it; we
are not in need of it, and I shall remember<span class="pagenum" id="Page_18">[Pg 18]</span>
you and to-day quite well without
it.’</p>

<p>Nora felt hurt and annoyed—not with
Nell, but herself. She ought to have
known better than to offer such a very
superior sort of young woman money.
It was thoughtless of her—unpardonable.
She thrust the offending bank-note
into her pocket, and turning, took Nell’s
hand.</p>

<p>‘Forgive me,’ she said, just as if she
had known her for years. ‘I have been
a fool. I ought to have seen that you
were above such paltry considerations.
You don’t look like a farmer’s daughter
to me. You seem as if you had been
used to such much better things. Have
you lived in Usk all your life?’</p>

<p>‘No, not all my life,’ said Nell.</p>

<p>‘Have you been a governess, then, or
anything of that sort? You seem to have
had such a very superior education,’ remarked
Nora.</p>

<p>‘Do you think so?’ replied Nell.</p>

<p>She certainly seemed a very difficult<span class="pagenum" id="Page_19">[Pg 19]</span>
sort of young woman to get on with.
Nora hardly knew how to proceed. But
then a sudden thought struck her (for
hers was a generous nature), and hastily
drawing a sapphire ring off her finger,
she tried to put it on one of Nell’s. It
was one that the earl had given her—that
he had been accustomed to wear
himself. It was what is called a gipsy
ring—a broad band of gold, in which
three unusually fine, dark-blue, flawless
sapphires were sunk—the only ring which
Ilfracombe had worn before his marriage.
He had put it on Nora’s finger at Malta
as soon as he was engaged to her, as
proxy for one better suited to her slender
hand, and she had refused to give it up
again. Now it struck her that it would
be just the sort of ring to present to a
young woman whose hands were rather
large and used to rough work. So she
tried to put it on the third finger of Nell’s
left hand.</p>

<p>‘They say it is unlucky to wear a ring
on your wedding-finger till you are married,’<span class="pagenum" id="Page_20">[Pg 20]</span>
she said, laughing; ‘but I am sure,
Miss Llewellyn, you are far too sensible
a girl to mind an old superstition.’</p>

<p>‘But what are you doing?’ asked Nell
sharply, as she drew her hand away.
There, on her finger glittered the ring she
knew so well—had seen so often on the
hand of her lover in the olden days.
She gazed at it for a moment, fascinated
as a bird by the eye of a snake; and
then, with a sharp cry, she dragged the
jewel off again, and it rolled under the
table and along the polished oak floor.</p>

<p>‘Oh, my poor ring,’ cried the countess,
somewhat offended at this determined
repulse.</p>

<p>‘Whose is it? Where did you get it?’
exclaimed Nell, as she rose to her feet
with flashing eyes and trembling limbs.</p>

<p>‘Where did I get it?’ echoed Nora,
with amazement. ‘Why, I bought it, of
course. Where should I have got it?’</p>

<p>‘No, you didn’t!’ said Nell, panting.
‘It was given to you!’</p>

<p>‘What an extraordinary girl you are,’<span class="pagenum" id="Page_21">[Pg 21]</span>
replied Nora, as she stooped to recover
her ring. ‘If it <em>were</em> given to me, you
may be sure I have every right to pass
it on to you if I choose. But what
makes you say so?’</p>

<p>‘<em>Who</em> gave it you?’ asked Nell, without
apologising for her strange behaviour.</p>

<p>‘My husband,’ replied Nora, without
thinking.</p>

<p>‘Your husband? Mr Lumley? And
from whom did <em>he</em> get it then?’ persisted
the farmer’s daughter.</p>

<p>‘Really, I don’t see what right you
have to question me after this fashion,’
said Nora. ‘I don’t know whom he got
it from. The jewellers, I suppose. But
pray don’t let us say another word upon
the subject. It is evident that, instead of
giving you pleasure, I have done just the
other thing. All my stupidity, I suppose.
I thought, as you would not take
money, that the ring would have been
more acceptable to you, but I was mistaken.
Now, pray don’t be angry. Let
us drop the subject altogether. Ah, here<span class="pagenum" id="Page_22">[Pg 22]</span>
comes your mother with the tea-tray. Mrs
Llewellyn, your daughter and I have been
having quite a little quarrel over this
affair. She won’t take money from me,
and she won’t take a present, so I don’t
know what to do. Perhaps you will be
able to make her a little more reasonable
after I have gone.’</p>

<p>‘Ah, ma’am, she’s very queer at times,
poor lass,’ said Mrs Llewellyn, for Nell
had taken the occasion of her entrance to
escape to the upper storey again. ‘She’s
been so pulled-down and weakened by the
fever, that father and I say we hardly
know her. Sometimes I think she’ll never
be the same girl again as she was before
she left home. But you mustn’t think
nothing more about giving her a present,
ma’am. What she did for you, you was
most heartily welcome to, as her father
would say, too, if he was here. Sir Archibald
has been a good landlord to us for
many years past; and if he hadn’t taken
it into his head to raise the rent, we
shouldn’t have anything to say against<span class="pagenum" id="Page_23">[Pg 23]</span>
him. But pray let me give you a cup
of tea, ma’am, with cream and sugar to
your liking.’</p>

<p>And, over the discussion of Mrs Llewellyn’s
excellent tea, Nell and her abrupt
behaviour were spoken of no more. But
Lady Ilfracombe, though she did not like
to vex the earl by mentioning the subject
to him, could not banish it from her
mind for some time afterwards.</p>

<h3 class="ls">CHAPTER <abbr title="Two">II</abbr>.</h3>
</div>


<p class="unindent"><span class="smcap">Whilst</span> Nora was walking thoughtfully
back to the Hall, Nell was raging up
and down the circumscribed limits of her
bedroom, with her heart and brain in a
tumult of suspicion and suspense. ‘The
ring! the ring!’ was all she could say
to herself. It <em>was</em> the earl’s ring, she
was sure of that—she had always seen
it on his finger—had so often drawn it
off playfully, and placed it on her own.
She recognised the very colour of the
sapphires; they were so darkly blue,
and yet clear as a summer sea; she
remembered Lord Ilfracombe having told
her the gems were flawless, and had been
presented in another form by an Eastern
potentate to some ancestor of his, who
had been Governor-General of India. She
would have sworn to them amongst a<span class="pagenum" id="Page_25">[Pg 25]</span>
thousand! How then had this woman,
this Mrs Lumley, got hold of them? Was
she a friend of Ilfracombe’s, and had he
given them to her? Nell thought it unlikely.
The earl had never been a <em>cavalier
des dames</em>; besides, he was married now,
and his family heirlooms belonged to his
wife. At that her thoughts flew to Mr
Portland. <em>He</em> was at the bottom of the
mystery perhaps. He had obtained the
jewel from Lord Ilfracombe, either by an
appeal to the latter’s generosity, or by
his odious habit of gambling, laid a bet
with the earl about it, or won it as a
stake. And then he must have given it
to this lady—this Mrs Lumley. What was
she to him then? Was their combined
presence at the Hall by accident or design?
Nell thirsted to learn the truth of it. She
felt it a desecration to have seen <em>his</em> ring
on the hand of another person, and to
have had it offered to herself in that
careless fashion, as if it were of no
intrinsic value. The ring that she had
known for so long—that had been clasped<span class="pagenum" id="Page_26">[Pg 26]</span>
in her hand by day—that she had lain
with her head on by night. Poor Nell
sobbed aloud in the agony of remembrance
as she recalled the fact that she had no
further part nor lot in it. It was something
more than mere suspicion that was
worrying her. We have a sixth sense,
called intuition, which, as a rule, we pay
too little attention to. The influences to
which we have been subject, the experiences
we have passed through, all leave
a subtle something behind them, which is
patent to the intuition of our acquaintances,
as theirs is to us. We may not
recognise it, but it guides, in a great
measure, our feelings and ideas, our likes
and dislikes. It was intuition that drew
Lady Ilfracombe to Panty-cuckoo Farm,
and made her conceive such an unusual
interest in Nell Llewellyn. It was intuition
that made Nell shrink from the
friendly advances of the woman who had
supplanted her in the affections of her
lover, and burn to discover the reason
that she was in possession of his ring.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_27">[Pg 27]</span>
It was fate—the fate that, laugh at it or
despise it as we will, still goes on silently
but surely, weaving the web of all our
destinies—that had drawn these actors in
the tragedy of life together to one meeting-place,
to fulfil the appointed end of the
drama which they had written for themselves.
The Countess of Ilfracombe went
back to Usk Hall rather depressed than
otherwise, for it is not pleasant to have
an intended kindness thrown back in your
face; and intuition told her that there was
something more beneath the surface of
Nell’s manner than she chose to let her
know; and Nell Llewellyn was vexed with
herself as well as the stranger, because
intuition told her that Nora was not at
fault, however the circumstances of her life
might have become entangled with her
own. She wished now that she had not
been so hasty, that she had asked a few
questions about the ring and where it
came from. By that means she might
have gained what she so longed for—news
of Lord Ilfracombe—without betraying<span class="pagenum" id="Page_28">[Pg 28]</span>
her own identity. Now that the
opportunity was past, Nell blamed herself,
and wished it might come over again.
Was it possible that she could bring about
another interview with the lady?—induce
her once more to speak of her gratitude
for the service rendered her—and so bring
the conversation round, without direct inquiry,
to her refusal of the sapphire ring.
Her next thought was, how should she
gain speech of Mrs Lumley without encountering
Jack Portland? Nell thought
it would be pretty safe to visit the Hall
in the evening. The beautiful warm nights
they were having then were very likely
to tempt the ladies of the party to walk
about the grounds after dinner, whilst she
knew from experience that that was the
very time the gentlemen would commence
to play billiards or baccarat. If she went
that way about eight o’clock that evening
she might have a chance of encountering
Mrs Lumley; at all events, some force,
of which Nell knew not the name, drew
her that way, and, as soon as their early<span class="pagenum" id="Page_29">[Pg 29]</span>
supper was over, she threw a light shawl
over her head and stole out, as she told
her mother, ‘for a breath of fresh air.’
The Hall stood on an eminence crowned
with wood. To the back of it was a
copse of fir trees, which formed an admirable
shelter from the north wind, and
extended down either side for some distance.
It was under cover of this plantation that
Nell approached the house. It was not
so thick but that she could see from it if
anyone was walking in the open grounds
that surrounded the Hall, and it was on
this plantation, naturally, that the back
premises, through which she gained access
to Mrs Hody’s apartments, looked. The
way to it, unless one used the drive, was
through some large meadows belonging to
the estate, and Nell had traversed the
whole length of these and gained the
back of the plantation, when she was
startled by seeing the figure of a man
approaching her. Her first impulse was
to turn and fly, forgetting in her simplicity
that it was the very mode to attract attention.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_30">[Pg 30]</span>
She had turned her back upon
the stranger, and was walking rapidly the
other way, when she heard him say,—</p>

<p>‘Don’t let me frighten you away. You
are quite welcome to walk here.’</p>

<p>It was the voice of Lord Ilfracombe.</p>

<p>She would have known it amidst the
assembled multitudes of earth, and the
sound of it made her forget everything
but himself. She forgot that he must
suppose her to be dead. She forgot that
he had voluntarily given her up, that he
was a married man—everything but that
he was there, and she loved him. At the
sound of her lover’s voice, as potent as
the trump at the last day to rouse her
slumbering soul, Nell turned sharply round,
and cried in a tone of ecstasy,—</p>

<p>‘Vernie! Oh, my Vernie!’ and flew
towards him.</p>

<p>She was the only person in the world
who had ever called him by that name.
Lord Ilfracombe’s father had died before he
could remember, and ever since his babyhood
he had been addressed, as is usual,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_31">[Pg 31]</span>
by his title only. Even his doting mother
and proud sisters had called him nothing
else. To everybody, he had been Ilfracombe,
and Ilfracombe alone. But when
he became intimate with Nell, and took
her about occasionally with him to Paris
or Rome, it became necessary to use a
little discretion, and he had entered their
names on the travellers’ books and passports
as Mr and Mrs Vernon, which was
his Christian name. So she had come to
call him ‘Vernie’ as a pet name, and he
had let her do it, because it was just as
well she should not be shouting ‘Ilfracombe’
after him wherever they went.
But the circumstance had identified her
with the name, and when she cried ‘Vernie!
Oh, my Vernie!’ in response to his words,
Lord Ilfracombe stood still—petrified, as
though he had encountered a voice from
heaven.</p>

<p>‘Who is it? What do you want?’ he
answered, trembling.</p>

<p>But Nell left him in no doubt. She
came flying to his breast, and threw her<span class="pagenum" id="Page_32">[Pg 32]</span>
arms round him, and pressed her warm
mouth on his, and displayed all the passion
she had been wont to do when he
returned to her after an absence from
home.</p>

<p>‘Vernie, my darling, my own darling!’
she reiterated, gasping for breath, ‘Oh,
I did not know you were here—I did not
know you were here! My God, I shall
die with joy!’</p>

<p>‘Nell!’ he uttered in an awed tone, ‘Nell,
is this really you?’</p>

<p>‘Yes, yes, it is I. Who else should it
be? Who has ever loved you as your poor
Nell?’ and she embraced him anew.</p>

<p>‘But—’ said the earl, incredulously, ‘<em>who</em>
was drowned then? They told me you
were drowned, Nell. How has this mistake
arisen, or have I been deceived by
design?’</p>

<p>‘Oh, Vernie, I <em>did</em> drown myself; that
is, I tried to—I wanted to—I felt I could
not live, my darling, without you or your
love. What was there for me to live for,
Vernie, when you were gone?’</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_33">[Pg 33]</span></p>

<p>All the earl’s remorse—all the hard things
he had thought of himself, and all the
kind thoughts he had had of her, since
he had learnt how they parted, rushed back
upon his mind now, and he, too, forgot
everything, except that his conscience had
been relieved from an intolerable burden,
and that the woman he held in his arms
had loved him faithfully for many years.</p>

<p>He laid his mouth upon hers, and kissed
her as warmly in return as ever he had
done in the days gone by.</p>

<p>‘Thank God, it is not true!’ he exclaimed.
‘Oh, my poor Nell, I have suffered hell
in thinking you had died by your own
hand for my sake.’</p>

<p>‘I, too, have been in hell,’ she whispered.
‘Oh, Vernie, why did you leave me? I
loved you so.’</p>

<p>‘I was a brute,’ replied the earl, ‘an
ungrateful, selfish brute; but I will make
you amends for it, if I die.’</p>

<p>What amends could he make her, except
by giving her back the love he had seemed
to withdraw? Nell thought of no other;<span class="pagenum" id="Page_34">[Pg 34]</span>
she would have accepted no other. She
held her heaven in her arms now—and
all the troubles of life had faded away.</p>

<p>‘Your love, your love! I only want
your love, Vernie,’ she whispered.</p>

<p>‘You have it, darling. You always had it,’
replied Ilfracombe, as he gazed at the lovely
face upturned to his in the moonlight.
‘But how thin and pale you are, Nell.
You are not like the same girl. What
has happened, dear, to change you so?’</p>

<p>‘I have been ill, Vernie’ answered Nell.
‘I have had a bad fever, and my trouble
has done the rest. I have had no peace—no
hope without you. I have been
unable to eat or sleep. How could I,
knowing you had given me up? Oh,
Vernie, why didn’t you kill me first? It
would have been so much kinder.’</p>

<p>Lord Ilfracombe groaned.</p>

<p>‘God forgive me! I never saw what
I had done before this night. Nell, will
you ever forgive me, or forget my base
ingratitude to you, who were always so
good to me? How can you say you<span class="pagenum" id="Page_35">[Pg 35]</span>
love me? A man like myself is unworthy
of any woman’s love. You ought by rights
to loathe and execrate my very name.’</p>

<p>‘But I don’t—I don’t. I love you still
with all my heart and soul. Oh, Vernie,
I was so wretched, so miserable, when I
came out to walk to-night, and now I’m
as happy as the day is long. You love
me still. That is all I want to know.’</p>

<p>‘But that won’t rectify the great wrong
I have done you, Nell. That won’t replace
you in the position my selfishness
hurled you from. You forget—perhaps
you don’t know—that I am—married.’</p>

<p>Nell drew herself a little away from him.</p>

<p>‘Oh, yes, I know it,’ she said in a low
voice; ‘but if you love me, Vernie, I have
the best part of you still.’</p>

<p>Lord Ilfracombe did not know what to
answer. The great emotion—the surprise,
almost the shock of finding that Nell still
lived, was over now in a great measure,
and he had time to remember his wife
and how much he loved her (as he
had never, even in the flush of his first<span class="pagenum" id="Page_36">[Pg 36]</span>
passion, loved the poor girl before him),
and what <em>she</em> would think if she could
see and hear him now. The disloyalty
of which he was guilty struck him like
a cold chill. Was he fated never to be
true to any one woman? He relaxed the
tight hold he had maintained on Nell,
and putting her a little away from him,
said gently,—</p>

<p>‘I do love you, my dear; I shall always
love you and remember the time we spent
together; but my marriage, you see, will
prevent my showing it as I used to do.’</p>

<p>‘Oh, yes, of course.’</p>

<p>‘Lady Ilfracombe is very good to me,
and deserves all the respect and esteem
that I can show her’ (he dared not speak
of his love for Nora to the poor wreck
who stood so patiently hanging on his
words), ‘and when she heard that you were
drowned, Nell, she was almost as sorry
as myself—’</p>

<p>‘Never mind that,’ interposed Nell, ‘I
don’t want to hear about it.’</p>

<p>‘But, of course, the past must be past<span class="pagenum" id="Page_37">[Pg 37]</span>
now. It cannot come over again. But you
must let me provide for your future, Nell.
I will not have—it is impossible that you,
who have been so near to me, should either
work for your living or live without the
comforts to which you have been accustomed.
It was very naughty of you to
refuse the settlement I wished to make
upon you—more, it was unkind to me,
and when I heard what you had said and
done, I was very unhappy.’</p>

<p>‘It was no use, Vernie. I could not
take it,’ said Nell.</p>

<p>‘But you will accept it now, darling,
won’t you? if only to prove you have
forgiven me all the wrong I have done you,
and to make me happy too—to wipe out
the bitter remorse I have felt—eh, Nell?’</p>

<p>She shook her head.</p>

<p>‘I couldn’t. Don’t ask me. Vernie,
my people know nothing of all this—of
what you and I were to one another.
They think I was just in service in your
house, and nothing more. You wouldn’t
shame me before them, would you? How<span class="pagenum" id="Page_38">[Pg 38]</span>
could I account for your giving me an
allowance? They would guess the truth
at once. Besides, I don’t want it. I
have everything that I can desire, except
your love. And now I have seen you,
and know you love me still, I am quite
happy, and want nothing more. Oh, God
bless you for your kindness to me. Say
you love me best of all the world, and
the other woman may have your title and
your money.’</p>

<p>He could not say what she asked him
to do, but he bent down his head again
and murmured in her ear,—</p>

<p>‘I have told you so, a dozen times.
Do you suppose that a few months can
make such a difference to a man as that? I
could wish things had been otherwise for us,
my poor Nell. I wish I had had the courage
to marry you years ago. I should have
been a happier man than I am ever likely to
be now, with the remembrance of your disappointment
haunting me like an evil spirit.’</p>

<p>‘No, no, it must not haunt you. It
is gone,’ she exclaimed with womanly unselfishness.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_39">[Pg 39]</span>
‘I shall never fret again now
I have seen you once more and heard
you speak. Kiss me, my Vernie—again—again!
Ah, that is sweet. How many,
many weary months it is—more than a
year—since I have felt your dear lips
on my own. It is like a draught of new
wine. It has made a strong woman of me.’</p>

<p>‘And where are you going now, Nell?’
he asked, as she disengaged herself from
his clasp.</p>

<p>‘To my home—back to Panty-cuckoo
Farm,’ she replied.</p>

<p>‘Ah, it is you, then, who live at Panty-cuckoo
Farm? Did you not stop Lady
Bowmant’s cobs as they were running away
this morning.’</p>

<p>‘What! they have told <em>you</em> too. What
an absurd fuss they make of nothing. The
lady, Mrs Lumley, was at the farm this
afternoon, worrying me about it.’</p>

<p>‘<em>Mrs Lumley!</em>’ he ejaculated, for though
Nora had not informed him of her visit,
he knew the real Mrs Lumley had not
been there. ‘What was she like?’</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_40">[Pg 40]</span></p>

<p>‘A slight, willowy-looking young woman,
with quick, brown eyes and pointed features.
She was very kind, but she teased me so
about taking a reward for doing nothing
at all. Why, I didn’t even stop them.
They stopped of themselves. All I did
was to get myself rolled over in the dust.
By the way,’ continued Nell, as a sudden
thought struck her, ‘are you very intimate
with Mrs Lumley, Vernie?’</p>

<p>‘By no means. Why do you ask?’</p>

<p>‘Because when I told her I couldn’t
accept money at her hands, she took a
ring off her finger and tried to put it on
mine. And it was <em>your</em> ring—the gipsy
ring set with sapphires—I recognised it
directly, and I thought I should have gone
mad with puzzling my brain where she
got it and if you had given it to her. Did
you?’</p>

<p>‘Given my sapphire ring to Mrs Lumley?
Most certainly not,’ replied the earl, who
guessed at once that his sharp-witted little
wife, in order to obey his injunction not to
disclose her real name, had borrowed the other<span class="pagenum" id="Page_41">[Pg 41]</span>
woman’s. ‘By Jove, that was cool of her.
I remember now she was fooling with my
ring last night and put it on her own
finger for a piece of fun. But to offer it
to you. Well, I wish you had taken it.
She would have looked very foolish when
I asked where it was gone, wouldn’t she?’</p>

<p>‘Oh, Vernie, I couldn’t have touched it.
It would have burned me. The dear ring
I had so often played with myself. I
have been crying all the afternoon for
thinking of it.’</p>

<p>‘Silly girl. I must get you one as like
it as I can. But now I am afraid I
must return to the house, or some of the
fellows may come out to look after me.’</p>

<p>‘Ah!’ said Nell, with a shudder. ‘You
have that horrid Mr Portland there.
Vernie, you will not tell him you have met
me, will you?’</p>

<p>‘Certainly not. It is the last thing I
should do. But I cannot understand why
all you women should seem to take a dislike
to dear old Jack. He is the best
fellow I know.’</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_42">[Pg 42]</span></p>

<p>‘Vernie, he was <em>never</em> your friend,’ said
Nell earnestly. ‘You wouldn’t believe it in
the old days. Try to believe it now.’</p>

<p>‘No, Nell I cannot, not till I have
some better proofs than another’s word.
Lady Ilfracombe is always dinning the
same thing into my ears, but without effect.
Jack has been always true to me so far as
I know, and I speak of a man as I find
him.’</p>

<p>‘Vernie,’ said Nell, after a pause, ‘is she
fond of you?’</p>

<p>He knew she alluded to his wife, and
answered,—</p>

<p>‘I think so. I hope so. If people have
to pass their lives together, it is best they
should be good friends, isn’t it?’</p>

<p>‘Yes,’ replied the girl, as she slowly
moved away.</p>

<p>He was just going to call out ‘good-night’
to her, when she came back rapidly.</p>

<p>‘Oh, Vernie, she doesn’t love you as <em>I</em>
did. Tell me that she doesn’t.’</p>

<p>‘No, dear, no,’ he answered gravely.
‘I don’t think she does.’</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_43">[Pg 43]</span></p>

<p>‘And you don’t love her as you did me?’
she persisted, and again Lord Ilfracombe
was able to answer with truth, ‘No.’</p>

<p>She threw her arms passionately round
him and inquired,—</p>

<p>‘When shall we meet again? Where
can I see you, Vernie? The minutes will
seem like hours till then.’</p>

<p>‘Nellie,’ he said seriously, ‘you know
it is impossible that we can meet like this
in any safety. I am overjoyed—more
overjoyed than I can tell you—to find you
are living, whom I have mourned as dead;
but I am here only for a few days, and my
time is not my own. Were I to say that
I would meet you here to-morrow evening,
I might be prevented, and you would think
me unkind. But you will know that I am
thinking of you all the same, and if we
meet it will be an unexpected pleasure for
us both, eh?’</p>

<p>He spoke kindly, but Nell, with the
unerring instinct which love gives to
women, read between the lines, and saw,
that whatever he might say, Lord Ilfracombe<span class="pagenum" id="Page_44">[Pg 44]</span>
would rather <em>not</em> meet her again
in Usk.</p>

<p>‘Yes, you are right,’ she answered slowly.
‘But, oh, it is so hard to see you once,
and, perhaps, not again for ages—like a
drop of water to a man who is dying of
thirst. Oh, Vernie, I must go. This has
been heaven to me, but so much too
short. Good-bye. God bless you. I will
pray every moment that we may meet
again.’</p>

<p>She heaved a deep sigh as she pronounced
her farewell, and flitted down the
grassy slope in the gloaming on her way
to the farm again. And someone saw
her—Hugh Owen, who had been lingering
about the road in hopes of catching a
glimpse of Nell, had watched more than
half her interview with Lord Ilfracombe.
He could not distinguish their words; he
was too far off; but he had seen the two
figures engaged in earnest conversation—he
had seen them approach each other,
and guessed the close embrace that followed—and
he had seen their parting, and that<span class="pagenum" id="Page_45">[Pg 45]</span>
Lord Ilfracombe watched the tall, graceful
shape of his companion till she was out of
sight; until, in fact, Nell had entered Panty-cuckoo
Farm, and left the young minister
in no doubt of her identity.</p>

<p>And what were Ilfracombe’s feelings as
he strolled back to Usk Hall? Not entirely
pleasurable ones, we may be sure. He could
not but be thankful that his worst fears for
Nell Llewellyn were allayed, that his conscience
was no longer burdened with the
thought that his desertion had been the
means of her death—but as he became
used to this relief, the old sensations regarding
her returned, and he could not
help acknowledging to himself that her
love wearied him—that Nora’s sharpness
of temper and standoffishness were as
<i lang="fr">sauce piquante</i> after Nell’s adoration—and
that, though he rejoiced to see her alive,
he was very sorry they should have met
in such close proximity to the house which
held his wife. He had had one or two
doubts lately as to whether another week
of Usk Hall would not suit him very well—now<span class="pagenum" id="Page_46">[Pg 46]</span>
he had none. The sooner they
were out of it, the better, and he should
speak to Nora to-night about joining his
mother’s party at Wiesbaden. She and
Nell must not meet again. He should
not reveal the identity of the latter to
Lady Ilfracombe, but all intercourse must
be stopped between them. He was sorry
for poor Nell—very, very sorry; but, hang
it all, Nora was his wife, and the prospective
mother of his children, and at all
hazards he would keep her for the future
out of the other woman’s way.</p>

<p>This is the difference men make between
their mistresses and their wives. The one
may be the infinitely better woman of the
two, but the law does not overshadow her,
so she must stand like Hagar apart in the
wilderness which she has created for herself.</p>

<h3 class="ls">CHAPTER <abbr title="Three">III</abbr>.</h3>
</div>


<p class="unindent"><span class="smcap">When</span> Lord Ilfracombe walked into the
lighted drawing-room of Usk Hall he
looked so pale and thoughtful that the
ladies began to rally him at once on his
supposed melancholy. Dear me, what could
it be? Who could he have met during
his evening ramble to make him look so
grave? Had she failed to keep her appointment,
or had she been unkind? The
whole list of little pleasantries with which
the fair sex assail men on such occasions,
with the idea of being arch and witty,
was recounted for his lordship’s benefit;
but he looked very disinclined to supply
food for their banter. His worry was so
pre-evident that his wife asked him if he
had a headache.</p>

<p>‘A little; nothing to speak of,’ he answered
quietly.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_48">[Pg 48]</span></p>

<p>‘Come along, old man, and have a
game at pool,’ said Jack Portland, in his
turn; ‘that will soon chase the vapours
away. I expect it’s Sir Archibald’s port
that’s done the job. It’s the most alluring
wine I’ve tasted for many a day.’</p>

<p>‘No, no. I won’t allow it. Nothing
of the kind,’ cried the jolly baronet;
‘there isn’t a headache in a dozen of it.
Lord Ilfracombe hasn’t had enough of it.
That’s what’s the matter with him.’</p>

<p>‘I think the sun may have touched
me,’ said Ilfracombe feebly; ‘it has been
very hot to-day.’</p>

<p>‘The sun; nonsense!’ exclaimed Mr
Portland. ‘I never heard you give that
excuse before, though we’ve been in several
hot countries together. Come along to the
billiard-room. You shouldn’t go wandering
away by yourself in this fashion, and
thinking over your sins. It’s enough to
give any man the blues. I couldn’t stand
it myself. You’ll forget it before the first
game’s over.’</p>

<p>‘No, thanks, Jack, not to-night. I don’t<span class="pagenum" id="Page_49">[Pg 49]</span>
feel fit to compete with your excellent
play. I’ll sit here instead and listen to
Nora’s singing.’</p>

<p>And he threw himself on a sofa by his
wife’s side as he spoke.</p>

<p>‘Ulysses at the feet of Penelope!’
sneered Mr Portland. ‘Well, Ilfracombe,
long as I’ve known you, I never saw you
turned into a carpet knight before.’</p>

<p>‘Only for this evening,’ said the earl
lazily, as he settled himself comfortably on
the sofa.</p>

<p>Jack Portland appeared quite aggrieved
by his defalcation.</p>

<p>‘Well, come along Sir Archibald and
Lumley and the rest of you fellows.
Don’t let us waste our time looking at
his lordship doing the lardi-dardi. He
owes me my revenge for the “fiver” he
made me disgorge last night; but I suppose
it’s no use trying to get it out of
him now.’ And, with a rude laugh, he
left the room.</p>

<p>Ilfracombe lent back against the shoulder
of his wife, and said,—</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_50">[Pg 50]</span></p>

<p>‘Sing something, darling, won’t you?
Something low and sweet, like “Come to
me.” My head is really painful, and I
want soothing to-night.’</p>

<p>‘I will sing anything you like,’ replied
Nora, as she rose and went to the piano.</p>

<p>Her voice was not powerful, but she had
received a first-rate musical education in
Malta, and was an accomplished drawing-room
singer. She ran through about half
a dozen songs, one after the other, accompanying
herself with a delicacy of touch
and artistic expression which was more
than half the battle. Ilfracombe listened
to her with a dreamy pleasure, but all the
time he was cogitating which would be
the best plea on which to induce Nora to
leave Usk Hall. He was determined
not to run the risk of her meeting Nell
Llewellyn again; but she was rather a
wilful little lady, and wanted to know the
why and the wherefore of everything. She
had asked him not to go to Wales, and
he had insisted on doing so—she had
begged they should not exceed the week<span class="pagenum" id="Page_51">[Pg 51]</span>
for which they had accepted the invitation,
and he had told her but the day before
that he wished to remain as long as Jack
did. Now, he had to invent some excuse
for leaving directly—what should it be?
He was not a bright man; had he been so
he would have known by this time that
with Nora honesty was decidedly the best
policy, because she was not easily deceived;
and had he told her the truth, she would
have been the first to wish to go. But he
had a poor idea of women. He fancied
that if his wife heard of the proximity
of his former mistress there would be a
‘row’—that Nora would not be able to
resist flaunting her triumph in the other
woman’s face, nor Nell of telling his wife
how far he had forgotten his duty to her
in the pleasure and relief of finding that she
(Nell) lived. Ilfracombe was a chivalrous
gentleman; but it was not in his nature to
love as either of these two women (whom
he so much distrusted) loved him. But he
managed to lay down a plan of action, as
he lounged on the sofa listening to his<span class="pagenum" id="Page_52">[Pg 52]</span>
wife’s singing, and as soon as they were
alone he opened fire.</p>

<p>‘Nora,’ he said abruptly, ‘I’ve made up
my mind to leave the Hall. How soon can
you be ready?’</p>

<p>As he had anticipated, Lady Ilfracombe
required to know the reasons which had
induced him to alter his plans.</p>

<p>‘Do you mean to go at once?’ she
questioned. ‘Why, it was only yesterday
that you promised Lady Bowmant to stay
until Mr Portland left. Has he altered
his plans also, or do you intend to leave
without him?’</p>

<p>‘What difference can that make to you?’
he said fretfully. ‘I have always thought
that you rather disliked Jack than otherwise.’</p>

<p>‘My likes or dislikes have nothing to
do with the matter, Ilfracombe, or we
should not be here at all,’ she answered.
‘All I want to know is, <em>why</em> we are
going so suddenly, and what I am to say
to our hostess.’</p>

<p>‘Say, why, anything. Surely you are<span class="pagenum" id="Page_53">[Pg 53]</span>
clever enough to invent an excuse without
my assistance? Pretend to have received
a letter from my mother, who desires us to
join her without delay, or get a relation to
die for the express purpose. Nothing can
be easier to a clever girl like you.’</p>

<p>‘Oh, I can tell as many lies as you wish,
Ilfracombe; and as for going I shall only
be too delighted to get away. Only it is
not treating me fairly to keep me so completely
in the dark. Something must have
happened to make you so anxious to be
off. Now, do tell me,’ she continued, as
she seated herself upon his knee, ‘you
know I’m as safe as a church. Have you
a row on with Portland or any of the
others? Or are Lady Bowmant’s attentions
becoming altogether too warm? I
gave her free leave to make love to you,
so you mustn’t judge her too hardly.’</p>

<p>‘No, my dear, don’t be ridiculous; it’s
nothing of that sort. But—well, to make
a clean breast of it, Nora, the play is awfully
hot here; enough to break the Bank
of England, and I think it’s gone on quite<span class="pagenum" id="Page_54">[Pg 54]</span>
long enough. Why, I should be almost
afraid to tell you how much money I have
lost since coming here. We have an ample
fortune; but, as you have often told me,
no fortune will bear such a continual strain
on it for long. And it’s impossible to
refuse playing with one’s host. So I have
decided that the sooner we are out of it
the better.’</p>

<p>‘You are right,’ said his wife, thoughtfully.
‘I was afraid of this all along. It
sounds dreadfully vulgar, I know, but
Usk Hall is in reality no better than a
private hell. But what will your <i lang="la">fidus
Achates</i>, Mr Portland, say to our going
so suddenly?’</p>

<p>‘Let him say what he likes,’ replied the
earl quickly. ‘I can’t be always answerable
to him for my actions. We’ll go
straight from here to Wiesbaden and join
my mother. No one can reasonably find
fault with that.’</p>

<p>‘No one has a right to find fault with
anything you may do,’ said Nora, though
her curiosity was aroused by hearing her<span class="pagenum" id="Page_55">[Pg 55]</span>
husband speak so curtly of the opinion
of his closest friend; ‘and I’m with you,
Ilfracombe, for one. When do you think
we <em>can</em> start? The day after to-morrow?
That will be Thursday.’</p>

<p>‘Couldn’t we manage it to-morrow
morning?’ asked the earl anxiously.
‘You received some letters by this afternoon’s
post. Say you didn’t open them
till bedtime, and then found one from
my mother, begging us to join her at
once as she is ill. Make Denham pack
your trunks to-night, and send word of
your intentions to Lady Bowmant the
first thing in the morning. Can’t you
manage it?’</p>

<p>‘Oh, Ilfracombe, what an arch deceiver
and plotter you would make,’ cried the
countess, laughing; ‘but, really and truly,
I don’t think we can be off quite so soon
as that. I’m not sure we should get a
train to London to suit us. Besides,
unless the dowager were dying, such extreme
haste would look very suspicious.’</p>

<p>‘Well, let her die then. You know<span class="pagenum" id="Page_56">[Pg 56]</span>
what I mean. Say the old lady is <i lang="la">in
extremis</i>, and we can easily revive her
as soon as we get over to Wiesbaden.’</p>

<p>‘But what is the necessity for such
extraordinary haste?’ demanded Nora.
‘It cannot only be because you have lost
money over this visit. Surely the delay
of a day or two cannot make much
difference in comparison with running the
risk of offending people who have honestly
wished to give us pleasure? You know
what my opinion has been all along,
Ilfracombe, that Mr Portland leads you
into a great deal of folly, and I shall be
but too thankful if this is the end of it;
still we owe something to the hospitality
of the Bowmants; and now we <em>are</em> here,
I cannot see what harm a day or two
more can do us.’</p>

<p>The earl saw that he was worsted in
the argument, so he contented himself
with begging his wife to make arrangements
to leave Usk as soon as she could,
determining inwardly not to lose sight of
her if possible till she had done so.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_57">[Pg 57]</span>
The announcement next morning of their
intended departure gave general dissatisfaction.
The Bowmants declared they had
not seen half the beauties of the surrounding
country, and that they had just made
arrangements for a picnic party, and a
dance, and a lot of other gaieties. Nora
expressed her sorrow at the necessity of
cutting their visit short; but the earl
said little, and gave one the impression
that the sudden determination had not
originated with himself. Jack Portland,
for one, took it so, and seized the first
opportunity he could to speak to Nora
on the subject.</p>

<p>‘Well, my lady,’ he commenced, ‘and
so this is <em>your</em> doing, is it?—your little
plan for dragging Ilfracombe from the
jaws of the sharks.’</p>

<p>‘I don’t understand you,’ said Lady
Ilfracombe.</p>

<p>‘Oh, yes, you do. This sudden idea
of leaving the Hall emanated from your
fertile brain alone. Ilfracombe had no
idea of it yesterday. He told me he<span class="pagenum" id="Page_58">[Pg 58]</span>
was enjoying himself up to date, and
should remain here as long as I did. But
you got hold of him last night and forced
the poor fellow to follow your lead. I see
through it all as plain as a pikestaff.’</p>

<p>‘Then you are utterly mistaken, Mr
Portland. I had nothing to do with it.
My husband told me yesterday that he
wished to go, and it was with some
difficulty that I persuaded him not to
leave this morning. But that would have
seemed so rude to the Bowmants.’</p>

<p>‘But what is at the bottom of it?’</p>

<p>‘You heard me tell Lady Bowmant
that we have received a letter from Wiesbaden,
to say that—’</p>

<p>‘Oh, stop that rot, do!’ exclaimed Mr
Portland elegantly. ‘We can put all
that in our eyes and see none the worse
for it. It’s the <em>real</em> reason I want to
know.’</p>

<p>‘I have no other to give you.’</p>

<p>‘Now, look here, Nora,’ said Jack Portland,
turning round short to confront her,
‘I told you very plainly, when we talked<span class="pagenum" id="Page_59">[Pg 59]</span>
business over at Thistlemere, that I would
not brook your interference between
Ilfracombe and myself. You have not
taken my caution, and must be prepared
for the consequences. I daresay you have
not forgotten them.’</p>

<p>‘Of course not,’ replied Nora coolly,
though her heart beat rapidly with apprehension;
‘but in this instance you blame
me unfairly. I give you my word of
honour—I swear before heaven, if that
will please you better—that I have had
nothing to do with this change in our
plans; indeed, I argued against it. It
was entirely my husband’s proposition, and
if you want any other reason but the one
I have given you, you must seek it from
himself.’</p>

<p>‘Very well, we will drop that branch
of the argument. But if you did not
originate it, you must prevent it. If you
choose to do it, it is in your power, and
if you do not choose to do it—well.’</p>

<p>He finished off with a shrug of his
broad shoulders, the interpretation of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_60">[Pg 60]</span>
which she knew to be, ‘take the consequences.’</p>

<p>‘You mean that you will produce those
letters?’ she said quickly.</p>

<p>‘I do.’</p>

<p>‘And if I consent to use my influence
to induce Ilfracombe to remain here, what
is to be my reward?’</p>

<p>Mr Portland did not immediately answer,
and his silence roused her fears. Nora had
often questioned herself which would be the
best means by which to regain possession
of her letters. She had tried force and
argument and entreaty, and all three had
failed. This cruel wretch kept her under
his thumb by the mere retention of that
little packet. She was a woman of courage
and determination, and by hook or by
crook she meant to have it. Had she
lived in a more barbarous time, she would
have slunk after him as he went to his
nightly rest, and stabbed him, without any
compunction, in the back, and been pleased
to watch his death struggles, and to hiss
into his ear at the last that she was<span class="pagenum" id="Page_61">[Pg 61]</span>
revenged. But, however much we may
occasionally long to take the law into our
own hands, the nineteenth century holds
certain obstacles against it. Nora was a
woman, also, of <i lang="fr">finesse</i> and intrigue. She
had several times argued whether, in lieu
of other ways, she could bring herself to
profess a lurking affection for Jack Portland
that should bring him once more to
her feet, as in the olden days, and make
him give for a fancied love what force
had no power to wrest from him. This
idea flashed into her mind again as she
waited for his reply, and felt she would
sacrifice everything except her honour to
bend him to her will.</p>

<p>‘What is to be my reward?’ she repeated,
‘if I do as you ask? Will you
give me the packet?’</p>

<p>Unwittingly he played into her hands.</p>

<p>‘What is to be <em>my</em> reward if I do?’
he asked.</p>

<p>In a moment Nora had made up her
mind. If the great stake at issue, a
stake the winning of which meant to<span class="pagenum" id="Page_62">[Pg 62]</span>
secure the happiness of her whole life,
was to be won by <i lang="fr">finesse</i>, she would
put forth all the <i lang="fr">finesse</i> in her power to
gain it, never mind what the consequences
might be. So she looked at
him coquettishly and said, like the arch
actress he had once called her,—</p>

<p>‘What reward do you want, Jack,
besides the condition you have already
named?’</p>

<p>‘Come, that’s better,’ said Mr Portland.
‘I haven’t seen a smile like that on
your ladyship’s face for many a day.
What I want is, a little more affectionate
interest from you, Nora, a little
more cordiality to your husband’s best
friend, a little more familiarity with him
before other people, that they may see
he is <i lang="fr">enfant gaté du maison</i>! I am sure
you understand me. Also, that you can
comply with my wishes if you chose.
Be more like what you were in Malta,
and I shall feel my reward is equal to
my sacrifice.’</p>

<p>‘And the sacrifice, Jack?’ she continued,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_63">[Pg 63]</span>
‘that is to be delivering up the letters
you hold of mine.’</p>

<p>‘Certainly, if you care to have them.
Now, Nora, I will make a bargain with
you,—you shall have your letters as soon
as ever you consent to fetch them with
your own fair hands.’</p>

<p>‘To <em>fetch</em> them?’ she echoed wonderingly.</p>

<p>‘To fetch them. Did I not speak
plainly? They are over at Panty-cuckoo
Farm with my other things. If you
will come to my room this evening, I
will engage to deliver your letters to
you myself.’</p>

<p>He thought she would have repudiated
the proposal as a fresh insult, but, to his
surprise, she answered firmly,—</p>

<p>‘I <em>will</em> come, if these are your only
conditions, Jack, I agree to them. It is
a <i lang="fr">risqué</i> thing to do, but I will do it.
I trust to your honour too implicitly to
be afraid of your permitting any scandal
to accrue from the act. And if you
fulfil your promise, Ilfracombe shall stay<span class="pagenum" id="Page_64">[Pg 64]</span>
on at Usk Hall as long as you do.
Is the bargain sealed?’</p>

<p>‘It is,’ replied Mr Portland, with the
utmost surprise.</p>

<p>He had not entertained the faintest idea
that Nora would agree to visit him at
Panty-cuckoo Farm. Was it possible she
still retained an inkling of affection for him,
and had her constrained manner since her
marriage been a blind for her real feelings?
Men are so conceited where the <i lang="fr">beau sexe</i>
is concerned, that Jack Portland, bloated
and disfigured as he was by excess and
dissipation, was yet quite ready to believe
that the Countess of Ilfracombe had been
unable to resist the feelings raised in
her breast by meeting him again. He
had made the proposal that she should
fetch her letters herself, because he
thought she would guess from that, that
he had no intention of giving them up
to her; but when she consented to do
so, he determined to make her secret
visit to him one more terror by which
to force her to influence her husband as<span class="pagenum" id="Page_65">[Pg 65]</span>
he should direct. Now, he hardly knew
what he should do. She was coming,
that was the extraordinary part of it.
Without any pressing or entreaty, the
Countess of Ilfracombe was actually coming
over to his room at night, to secure
her packet of letters. Well, it was the
very ‘rummiest go’ he had ever heard
of in his life before.</p>

<p>‘You must be very careful that you
are not seen to leave the Hall,’ he
said to her.</p>

<p>Now that she had agreed to come, he
began to wish he had never said anything
about it. What if his dear friend Ilfracombe
got wind of the matter? Would
not that render his wife’s efforts on Mr
Portland’s behalf futile ever afterwards?
The earl was very suave and easily led;
but Jack Portland knew him too well to
suppose he would ever forgive an offence
against his honour. If Nora’s good name
were compromised by his nearest and
dearest friend, that friend would have to
go, if the parting broke his heart. Added<span class="pagenum" id="Page_66">[Pg 66]</span>
to which Mr Portland had no idea of
getting into even an imaginary scrape
for Lady Ilfracombe; he did not like
her well enough. He regarded her only
as a convenient tool in his hands which
he had no intention of letting go.</p>

<p>‘Perhaps, after all,’ he said cautiously,
‘you had better not risk it. It <em>would</em>
be a risk, you know, and it would be
awkward to have to give Ilfracombe
an explanation of the affair, wouldn’t
it?’</p>

<p>‘I shall be careful to run no risk,’
was her reply.</p>

<p>‘But suppose some of the farm people
should see you, what excuse could you
make for being there?’</p>

<p>‘I should make no excuse at all. I
have as much right as other people, I
suppose, to take a moonlight ramble.
What time shall I meet you? It must
not be too late, as I must go upstairs
when the other ladies do.’</p>

<p>‘That is not very early, as a rule,’
said her companion; ‘let us say midnight.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_67">[Pg 67]</span>
Ilfracombe will be safe in the
card or billiard-room at that time, and
not likely to notice what you are about.’</p>

<p>‘And how will you manage to leave
the party without observation?’</p>

<p>‘Oh, I shall trust to chance; but you
may be sure I shall be there. And—and—if
you fail me, Nora, why, I shall
understand that you value your reputation
more than you do—me, or your
husband’s good opinion, because in that
case—’</p>

<p>‘I understand. You need not recapitulate.
But I shall not fail you. It
will seem quite like old times having an
assignation with you, Jack. Do you
remember the night I met you down by
the landing-place at Valetta, and that
horrid man Pietro followed me all the
way, and only showed his ugly face
just as I had reached your side? I
always believed that it was Pietro who
betrayed us to papa, for he was sometimes
very impertinent in his manner to
me afterwards. Oh, and have you forgotten<span class="pagenum" id="Page_68">[Pg 68]</span>
the time when you took me
out in a boat and we got caught in a
squall, and had to put in to shore, and
remained nearly the whole day away in
a little <i>estaminet</i>? What a fearful row
papa made about it, and I had to pretend
I had been alone, though I don’t
think he believed me. Papa certainly
did hate you, Jack, though I never
could understand why. I suppose it was
all the money, or, rather, the lack of it.’</p>

<p>And here Nora heaved a most deceitful
sigh.</p>

<p>‘Do you ever regret that there was any
obstacle between us?’ asked Mr Portland
persuasively. ‘Do you think you could
have been happy as Mrs Jack Portland,
if Ilfracombe had not come between us?’</p>

<p>‘Why, of course, I told you at the
time I should,’ said Nora.</p>

<p>‘Ah, well, perhaps things are better
as they are,’ replied her companion; ‘for
I don’t think you were ever cut out for
a poor man’s wife; you are too pretty
and dainty and refined, my lady, for that.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_69">[Pg 69]</span>
And if you had been miserable, I should
have been so also. And so you really like
me well enough still to meet me at the
farm this evening, and fetch your dear little
letters. I shall be so glad to have you
for a few moments to myself. It will
seem quite like the dear old times.
Here, I can never say half a dozen
words to you without as many old cats
prying into our faces. Well, <i lang="fr">au revoir</i>,
my dear, be punctual, as our time will
be limited—twelve o’clock to-night. I
had better not stand talking to you any
longer now.’</p>

<p>‘I will be there,’ answered the countess
mechanically, as she turned round and
walked another way.</p>

</div>


<p class="unindent"><span class="smcap">Hugh Owen</span> was in a burning rage. From
the high road he had witnessed Nell’s
meeting with the Earl of Ilfracombe, and
he put the worst construction upon what
he saw. Because this young man was a
minister, it must not be supposed that he
was naturally amiable and good. On the
contrary, he possessed a very high temper,
and at times an ungovernable one, and it
was raging now. He had perceived a
marked difference in Nell lately. She was
not the same girl who had confessed her
grievous fault to him in Panty-cuckoo
Farm, nor promised so sweetly to follow
his fortunes to South Africa in the Long
Meadow subsequently. For a little while
after the latter event, she had been very
subdued and gentle with him, as though<span class="pagenum" id="Page_71">[Pg 71]</span>
she were contemplating the serious step
to which she had conditionally pledged
herself; but since the folks had returned
to Usk Hall, she had declined either
to walk with him or talk with him. Her
old feverish, excitable manner had seemed
to return, though Hugh had not liked to
connect it with the fact of the Hall being
occupied until the fatal moment when he
was passing by Sir Archibald’s field and
witnessed Nell and the earl in close conversation.
Who could she be talking
with? What could she have to say to
him? Why were their faces so close
together? These were the questions
that haunted poor Hugh for hours afterwards,
and to which he could find no
satisfactory solution. He could not trust
himself to confront Nell as she went
back to the farm—he was afraid of what
he might say to her—so he resolved
to sleep over it, if the restless, miserable,
disturbed slumbers which followed his
discovery could be called sleep. But on
the next day he felt he must know the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_72">[Pg 72]</span>
reason of what he had seen. The remembrance
of it came between him and
his duties. He would not be able to
preach and pray with an earnest and
single heart until it had been relieved
of the awful doubt that assailed it. So,
the day after, he set forth for the farm,
and found Nell, for a wonder, alone
and free to receive him. The fact is,
she did not dare go out, as she had
been used to do lately, for fear of encountering
Lord Ilfracombe in the company
of his wife or friends. She felt as
if she could not bear the sight—as if she
should proclaim her right to him before
all the world. And that would make
him angry—he, who loved her still above
all other things; for so had she interpreted
his words of the night before.
She had been in a state of beatification
ever since, and her mother knew
no more what to make of her present
mood than she had done of her previous
one. It would be difficult to say what
Nell expected or believed would come<span class="pagenum" id="Page_73">[Pg 73]</span>
of the interview which had made her
so happy. Apparently she had given
herself no time to think. She knew perfectly
well that her intimacy with Ilfracombe
was over and done with, and that
thenceforward she could have no part
nor lot in him or his affairs. She knew
she should never enter his house again,
nor associate with his acquaintances, nor
enjoy any of his good things. Yet she
felt supremely happy. To understand
her feelings, one must not only be a
woman—one must be a woman who has
loved and lost, and found that whatever
the loss, the love remained as it was.
Women have greater faith than men,
as a rule, in the unseen and the compensation
of an after life. They think
more of the heart than of the body of
the creature they love, and give them
the hope of a reunion in another world—of
retaining the eternal affections of
the man they care for; and they will
try and content themselves with the
thought of the future. Far better that,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_74">[Pg 74]</span>
they say, than his companionship on
earth, whilst his heart is the property
of some other woman. The earl had
managed to deceive Nell so well without
intending to deceive her, that she
was already disposed to pity Lady
Ilfracombe, who could only lay claim
to his worldly goods. As she had told
him, ‘Say you love me best of all the
world, and the other woman can have
your title and your money.’ She had
sat indoors all day dreaming over the
unexpected happiness that had come to
her—recalling in fancy every word he
had uttered, every look he had given,
every kiss he had pressed upon her
happy mouth. The wretched interval
that lay between them had vanished like
a dream. She had forgotten the abject
misery with which she had received the
news of his marriage, the despairing
attempt at suicide that followed it,
her return home, and the apathetic
existence she had led since—all had
disappeared under the magic touch of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_75">[Pg 75]</span>
love. She was no longer Nell o’ Panty-cuckoo
Farm, as the neighbourhood
called her; she was Lord Ilfracombe’s
housekeeper, the woman he had chosen
to be the mistress of his home. She
was his love, his lady, his daily companion.
She looked with a kind of
pathetic curiosity at the print dress she
wore, at the simple arrangement of her
chesnut hair, at her ringless fingers and
wrists unadorned by bangles. They had
all gone—the silks and satins, the golden
combs and hairpins, the jewels and laces;
but <em>he</em> remained, the pride and jewel of
her life. ‘Vernie’ loved her.</p>

<p>It was so wonderful, so delightful, so
unexpected, that her head swam when
she thought of it. She was just considering
whether she might not venture
to stroll up the long fields again that
evening—whether ‘Vernie’ might not
come out as he had done the evening
before in hopes of meeting her, when
Hugh Owen raised the latch of the
farmhouse door and walked unceremoniously<span class="pagenum" id="Page_76">[Pg 76]</span>
in. His entrance annoyed Nell.
It disturbed her beautiful reverie, put to
flight all her golden dreams, and made
her fear lest his visit might be prolonged
so as to interfere with her plans. The
welcome he received, therefore, was not,
to say the least of it, cordial.</p>

<p>‘Neither father nor mother are at
home, Hugh,’ she said, as she caught
sight of him, ‘and I’m just going out.
You’ve come at an unlucky moment.’</p>

<p>‘So I always seem to come now,’ he
answered; ‘but I have a word or two to
you, Nell, that can’t be put off; so I
must ask you to listen to me for a few
minutes first.’</p>

<p>‘They must be very few, then, for I’ve
got work of my own to do,’ she replied.</p>

<p>‘It’s the work you do that I’ve come
to speak to you about,’ said the young
man, ‘and I claim the right to do so.
I was sauntering up and down the road
last night, Nell, in the hope of catching
sight of you, when I saw you cross the
meadow over there and meet a man and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_77">[Pg 77]</span>
talk to him for better than half an hour.
Who was he?’</p>

<p>Nell flared up in her impetuous manner
at once.</p>

<p>‘And what business is that of yours?’
she exclaimed.</p>

<p>‘Why, every business in the world!
Whose should it be but mine? Haven’t
you promised to be my wife?’</p>

<p>‘No!’ cried the girl boldly.</p>

<p>‘No? What! not in the Long Meadow
behind father’s house?’ he returned in
astonishment.</p>

<p>‘I said if my people ever emigrated—which
they never will do—that I would go
with them as your wife; but that was
only a conditional promise, and I’ve
altered my mind since then. I shall never
be anybody’s wife now.’</p>

<p>‘If I saw rightly last night, Nell, perhaps
it will be as well. Who was the
gentleman you met and talked with for so
long? What is he to you? Where have
you met him before? What had you to
say to him?’</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_78">[Pg 78]</span></p>

<p>‘Which of your questions will you have
answered first?’ asked Nell. ‘And what
is it to you who I choose to talk to?
Are you my master, or am I a child to be
catechised after this fashion? I shall see
and speak to whom I like, and I refuse
to say anything more about it.’</p>

<p>‘Nell,’ said Hugh in a sorrowful voice,
‘when you told me your history I was
truly sorry for you. I thought what a
terrible thing it was that such a respectable
girl should lower herself to the
level of the lowest of her sex; but I believed
it was a misfortune—a step into
which you had been led with your eyes
shut—and that you regarded it with horror
and loathing. I must have thought so,
you know, or I should never have proposed
to make you my wife.’</p>

<p>‘Well, and what is all this tirade leading
to?’ said Nell.</p>

<p>She felt sorry for Hugh, but not a bit
ashamed of herself, and the impossibility of
explaining the matter to him made her
irritable and pert.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_79">[Pg 79]</span></p>

<p>‘To a very sorrowful conclusion, Nell.
I have seen, ever since this party of
gentlemen and ladies came to the Hall,
that you are altered. You have become
restless and uneasy; you have refused to
walk out with me any more; and you
have avoided my company. I can only put
two and two together, and draw my conclusions
from that. I have often heard it
said that if once a woman is led astray
to lead what people call a “gay life,” she
is never contented with a quiet, domestic
existence again, but I was loath to believe
it of you, who seemed so truly sorry for the
past and all the shame and disgrace it
had brought you. But what am I to think
now? I see you with my own eyes meet
a man who looked to me in the gloaming
like a gentleman, and talk familiarly with
him, and yet you won’t tell me his name,
nor what your business was with him.’</p>

<p>‘No, I won’t,’ she replied determinedly,
‘because it is no concern of yours.’</p>

<p>‘But I say it <em>is</em> my concern, and the
concern of everybody that has an interest<span class="pagenum" id="Page_80">[Pg 80]</span>
in you, Nell. Where there is deceit there
must be wrong. Do your father and
mother know this gentleman, and of your
meeting him? Did you tell them?’</p>

<p>‘I did not, and I shall not. It is my
private affair, and I shall keep it entirely
to myself.’</p>

<p>The young man rose indignantly.</p>

<p>‘Then I’ll tell you now what I didn’t
like to mention before, and that is that I
saw him kiss you. I am sure of it from the
closeness with which he held you. Oh, for
shame, Nell, for shame!’</p>

<p>‘And what if he did?’ cried Nell, with
crimson cheeks; ‘that also is my business
and not yours.’</p>

<p>‘Your business, yes, and you may keep
it so!’ exclaimed Hugh Owen hotly, as his
eyes blazed with anger. ‘I see you now,
Nell Llewellyn, in your true colours, and
would to God I had known you from the
first. Your penitence was all assumed, put
on to catch an unwary fool like myself, because
there was no one better within reach.
Your sorrow, too, for the loss of your lover<span class="pagenum" id="Page_81">[Pg 81]</span>
was another sham, easily consoled by the
kisses of a stranger. You are not a true
woman, Nell. You are unfit for the love
or consideration of any honest man. You
are an outcast and a wanton, and I will
never willingly speak to you again.’</p>

<p>‘I will take good care you don’t,’ cried
Nell in her turn. ‘I have more powerful
friends than you think of—friends who
will not see me insulted by a common
farmer’s son. I know I promised conditionally
to be your wife, but I did it for
your sake, not my own. I should have
hated the life—the very thought is distasteful
to me. So never think of me in
that light or any light again. I break off
with you from this moment. The man I
met last night is worth ten thousand of
you. I value his little finger more than
your whole body. I would rather beg my
bread with a gentleman than sit on a
throne with a clod like you. Now you
have the whole truth. Make what you
like of it.’</p>

<p>‘Oh, stop, stop. In mercy to yourself,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_82">[Pg 82]</span>
stop,’ cried the young man, as with both
hands clapped to his ears he ran out of the
house.</p>

<p>Nell felt rather subdued when left to
herself. She was not quite sure how far
she had betrayed her secret, or if she had
said anything in her wrath to lead to
Lord Ilfracombe’s identity. But on revision
she thought not. Hugh did not
know the name of her former lover—he
had not heard those of the guests at the
Hall. There was no chance of his gaining
a knowledge of the truth. And, as for
the rest, it was just as well he had seen
for himself that they could never be more
to each other than they were at present.
And then she resolved into another of the
pleasing day-dreams from which his entrance
had disturbed her. Her father and
mother came bustling in after a little
while full of complaints and anxiety. One
of their best cows had shown symptoms
of dangerous illness, and every remedy
that the farm could boast of was set in
motion at once.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_83">[Pg 83]</span></p>

<p>‘Come, my lass,’ cried Mrs Llewellyn,
as she entered the parlour, ‘you must
bestir yourself and help me. Father and
I are in sad trouble. Bonnie is as bad
as she can be, and if we can’t stop the
symptoms she’ll be dead before the morning.
Ay, but misfortunes never seem to
come single, what with the raising of the
rent and other troubles. I’ve set Betty
to put on all the hot water she can, and
we must choose the oldest blankets we
have for fomentations. Bring the lamp
with you, Nell, I want to find the proper
medicines in father’s chest.’</p>

<p>The girl snatched up the light, and
followed her mother to where Mr Llewellyn
kept a chest full of veterinary
drugs.</p>

<p>‘That ain’t it, and that ain’t it,’ the old
woman kept on saying as she pulled
bottle after bottle to the light. ‘Ah, I
think this is the stuff that cured Daisy
last year.</p>

<p>She pulled out the cork with her teeth,
and tasted a little of the brown, nauseous-looking<span class="pagenum" id="Page_84">[Pg 84]</span>
mixture, but spat it out immediately
on the floor. ‘God save us, that’s
the lotion for the sheep’s backs, deadly
poison. Don’t you ever touch that, my
girl. It’ll take the skin off your tongue
in no time.’</p>

<p>‘Am I likely?’ remonstrated Nell seriously;
‘but suppose you had given it to
the poor cow by mistake? Why don’t you
label it plainly “Poison,” mother, and then
there would be no fear of an accident?’</p>

<p>‘Ay, my lass, that’s a good thought.
Don’t put it back, Nell, but carry it to
your bedroom and put it a-top of the wardrobe.
It will be safe enough there, and
when we’re a bit less busy you shall write
a label for it. It’s arsenic, I believe. I
know last year father gave a drop or two
by mistake to one of the cats that was
bad in its inside, and the poor beast was
dead in a few minutes. <em>This</em> is the cows’
mixture,’ said Mrs Llewellyn, pulling out
a second bottle from the recesses of the
old trunk. ‘Not dissimilar looking, are
they? but, Lor’, what a difference in their<span class="pagenum" id="Page_85">[Pg 85]</span>
effects. This is some of the finest stuff
we ever had, made from a receipt of
farmer Owen’s. Take it down to father
at once, Nell, for he’s in a hurry for it.
and I’ll fetch the blanket. And don’t forget
to put the other a-top of your wardrobe,’
she called out after her daughter.</p>

<p>The poor cow was very bad, and for
some hours the whole household was occupied
in providing remedies and applying
them. When ten o’clock struck, and the
animal was pronounced to be out of danger,
Nell was regularly tired out, and hardly
inclined to sit down to supper with her
parents, but the farmer would not hear of
her leaving them.</p>

<p>‘Come on, lass,’ he said; ‘I’ve news
for you, only this bothering cow put it
clean out of my head. Grand news, Nelly.
You’ll never guess it, not if you tried for a
twelvemonth.’</p>

<p>Nell returned to the table, white and
scared looking.</p>

<p>‘News about <em>me</em>, father?’ she said.</p>

<p>‘Well, not about you exactly, but that<span class="pagenum" id="Page_86">[Pg 86]</span>
concerns you all the same. Now, who
do you suppose has come to the
Hall, and is staying along of Sir Archibald?’</p>

<p>Then she knew he had heard of Lord
Ilfracombe’s arrival, and set her teeth, lest
she should betray herself.</p>

<p>‘How should I know, father?’ she said
tremblingly. ‘I haven’t been near Mrs
Hody for the last week. Is it the prince
whom they expected?’</p>

<p>‘The prince, be d—d!’ exclaimed the
farmer. ‘What’s the value of a foreign
prince beside one of our own English
noblemen? I wouldn’t give you <em>that</em> for
the prince,’ snapping his fingers. ‘No;
it is somebody much better and higher.
It’s your old master, the Earl of Ilfracombe,
and his lady. What do you think
of that?’</p>

<p>‘The Earl of Ilfracombe!’ echoed Nell,
in order to gain time. ‘But who told you,
father?’</p>

<p>‘Jackson, the coachman, to be sure,
who drove them both home from the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_87">[Pg 87]</span>
railway station, and who should know
better than he? He says the earl
is a fine-looking young man, as fair as
daylight, and his lady is a nice, pretty
creature too. I thought I should surprise
you, Nell. You’ll be wanting to go
up to the Hall to see ’em both, now, won’t
you?’</p>

<p>‘Oh, father, why should I go to see
them? His lordship won’t want to see
me. Most likely he’s forgotten my very
name.’</p>

<p>‘Well, Nell, I <em>am</em> surprised to hear
you talk so!’ exclaimed her mother. ‘It
don’t look as if you knew much about
the gentry, who are always glad to see
servants as have behaved themselves
whilst in their service. But perhaps
you’re afraid the earl is annoyed with
you for leaving him so suddenly, and just
as he was bringing home his bride. Is
that it?’</p>

<p>‘Perhaps so, mother,’ said the girl,
looking very much confused.</p>

<p>‘Ah, I was always doubtful if there<span class="pagenum" id="Page_88">[Pg 88]</span>
wasn’t something queer about your coming
back so suddenly, and so I’ve told
your mother,’ remarked Mr Llewellyn
dubiously. ‘But if it was so, why, you
must go over to the Hall to-morrow
morning and ask his lordship’s pardon;
and perhaps mother, here, can find some
little thing as you could take up as
an offering for his lady. Can you,
mother?’</p>

<p>‘Oh, I daresay,’ replied Mrs Llewellyn,
‘she might fancy a pen of our Minorca
fowls or Cochins. I suppose they’ve
a fine farm down at Thistlemere, Nell?’</p>

<p>‘Yes, I suppose so. But, mother, I
cannot go and see them, or take Lady
Ilfracombe any presents. It will seem
like intrusion. They’ve not asked to see
me, and I’m only a discharged servant,
after all.’</p>

<p>‘Rubbish! Nonsense! What are you
talking about?’ exclaimed the old farmer
angrily. ‘A discharged servant! Why,
didn’t you tell mother and me that you
gave his lordship warning yourself?<span class="pagenum" id="Page_89">[Pg 89]</span>
Haven’t you told the truth about your
leaving? Is there anything hid under
it all as we know nothing about? Come,
now, no more secrets, if you please;
let us have the plain truth at once, or I
will go up the first thing in the morning
and see his lordship myself.’</p>

<p>‘Lor’, father, don’t be so hard on
the lass!’ exclaimed his wife. ‘You’ve
turned her as white as a lily with your
noise. What should be under it, except
that the maid wanted to come home?
And time enough, too, after being three
years away. Don’t you mind him, Nell,
my girl. He’s just put out and cranky
about the cow. If you don’t want to
see his lordship, why, no more you shall.
Here, sup up your beer and get to bed.
I don’t half like the way in which you
flushes on and off. It’s just how my
sister’s girl went off in a waste. You
sha’n’t be worried to do anything as
you don’t wish to, take my word for
it.’</p>

<p>‘That’s how you fools of women go on<span class="pagenum" id="Page_90">[Pg 90]</span>
together, without a thought of the business,
and how it’s going to the devil,’
grumbled her husband. ‘Here’s Lord Ilfracombe
come here, as you may say, in the
very nick o’ time, and Nell the very one
to ask a favour of him, and you cram her
head with a pack o’ nonsense about not
going near him. Sir Archibald is going
to raise the rent, and send us all to the
workhouse, when a word from his lordship
might turn his mind the other way,
especially if Nell put it to him, on account
of her long service and good character,
and you tell her not to do it. Bah! I’ve
no patience with you.’</p>

<p>‘Oh, that’s a different thing,’ quoth
the old woman. ‘If Nell can get Lord
Ilfracombe to plead with Sir Archibald
on our account, why, of course, she’ll do
it, for her own sake as well as for ours;
won’t you, my lass?’</p>

<p>‘Plead with Lord Ilfracombe!’ cried
Nell hysterically. ‘No, no, indeed, I
cannot. What has he to do with Sir
Archibald’s rents? He is only a guest<span class="pagenum" id="Page_91">[Pg 91]</span>
in the house. It would be too much to
ask. It would place him in an unpleasant
position. I would not presume to do such
a thing.’</p>

<p>Both her parents rounded on her at
once.</p>

<p>‘Well, of all the ungrateful hussies as
I ever saw,’ said her father, ‘you’re the
worst. You come home to see your
poor parents toiling and moiling to keep
a roof above their heads, and nigh breaking
their hearts over the raising of the
rent and the idea of having to leave the
old homestead, and you refuse even to
speak a word to save them from starvation.’</p>

<p>‘Well, I never did!’ cried her mother.
‘Here you’ve been home for nearly a
year, and no more use than a baby, what
with your London training and your
illness, and your fid-fads and the first
thing as your poor father asks you to
do for him you downright refuse. I
didn’t think it of you, Nell, and I begin
to fear, like father, that there must be<span class="pagenum" id="Page_92">[Pg 92]</span>
something under it all as you’re afraid to
let us know.’</p>

<p>‘But I shall know it for all that,’ said
the farmer; ‘for I’ll see this fine lord with
the break of day, and ask him downright
under what circumstances you left his
service. If he’s a gentleman, he’ll answer
the question, and give me some sort of
satisfaction. I won’t put up with this
sort of treatment from you no longer, my
lass, and so I give you plain notice.’</p>

<p>‘Very well. Do as you like. It’s all
the same to me,’ cried Nell, as she
rose from the table and rushed from the
room.</p>

<p>Her sleeping apartment was over the
lodgers’ rooms, and as she reached it she
locked the door and flung herself on the bed,
face downwards, in an agony of apprehension.
What was going to happen next?
she asked herself. What was to be the
next scene in her life’s tragedy? Would
her irate father force the truth from
the earl, or would he guess it from his
embarrassment? Would the story come<span class="pagenum" id="Page_93">[Pg 93]</span>
to the ears of the countess, and make
mischief between her husband and herself?
There seemed to be no end to
the horrors that might happen from her
father having gained knowledge of the
proximity of her former employer. And
if he confided his doubts to Hugh Owen,
or any of the Dale Farm party, might
not he add his quota to the chapter of
horrors by relating what he had witnessed
in the field the night before?</p>

<p>Poor Nell could get no rest that night
for thinking of these things, and wondering
how she should come out of them
all.</p>

<p>She rose after a while and bathed
her burning and swollen eyelids in cold
water, and took a seat by the open
casement and out-gazed into the calm,
peaceful night. The air was warm and
balmy, but there were few stars, and the
moon was in her first quarter.</p>

<p>How long she had sat there she did
not know, till she heard the church clock
chiming the hour of twelve, and thought<span class="pagenum" id="Page_94">[Pg 94]</span>
to herself that it was time she lay down
on her bed. But just as she was about
to do so, her attention was arrested by the
figure of a woman walking slowly and
furtively over the grass beneath the
window.</p>

<p>Nell did not know who she was, nor
what she came for; but not unnaturally
supposing that she would not be there at
that time of night unless she needed the
assistance of her mother or herself in
some sudden emergency, she waited quietly
until the stranger should knock or call out
in order to summons her. To her surprise,
however, the woman did not go round to
the principal entrance to the farmhouse,
but lingered about the grass-plat, walking
backwards and forwards, and occasionally
glancing over her shoulder in the direction
of the Hall.</p>

<p>Nell’s curiosity was now fully aroused,
but she made no sign to arrest the attention
of the visitor. On the contrary, she
drew further back from the window, so as
to be entirely concealed by the dimity<span class="pagenum" id="Page_95">[Pg 95]</span>
curtain that shaded it. From this vantage-ground
she presently saw the woman joined
by a man, who she at once recognised as
Mr Portland. Nell’s first feeling was indignation
that he should presume to make
her mother’s house a place of assignation;
but when he commenced to talk, she could
only listen, spellbound.</p>

</div>


<p class="unindent">‘<span class="smcap">And</span> so you have kept your word, my
lady,’ he said nonchalantly.</p>

<p>‘Had you any doubt that I should do
so?’ she answered.</p>

<p>‘It would not have been the first time
if you had broken it,’ was the sarcastic
rejoinder.</p>

<p>‘Now, look here Jack,’ said the woman,
‘you have not brought me here at this
time of night to upbraid me for the
inevitable past, surely? You must know
that I run a fearful risk in coming here.
You must know also that only one object on
earth would have brought me. Be merciful
as you are great, and don’t keep me fooling
my time away in order to listen to your
platitudes. Isn’t the subject of our former
relations with each other rather stale?’</p>

<p>‘It will never be stale to me, Nora,’<span class="pagenum" id="Page_97">[Pg 97]</span>
replied Mr Portland; ‘and the melancholy
fact that you preferred Ilfracombe to myself
is not likely to make me forget it.’</p>

<p>‘<em>Ilfracombe!</em>’ thought Nell, from her
post of observation, ‘can this really be
the countess? Oh, how grossly she must
be deceiving him. Prefer Ilfracombe to
him! Why, of course it <em>must</em> be she. I
will hear every word they say now, if I
die for it.’</p>

<p>‘That is nonsense,’ resumed Nora, ‘you
never really cared for me, Jack; and if
you did, the sentiment has died long
ago. Don’t let us twaddle, pray, but
come to business.’</p>

<p>‘I thought the twaddle (as you call
it) was part of our business, but I am
willing to let it drop. What has your
ladyship to say next?’</p>

<p>‘I want to ask you something which
I have been afraid to mention with so
many eavesdroppers as we have round
us at the Hall. You knew that <i lang="fr">chère
amie</i> of Ilfracombe’s—Miss Llewellyn—of
course.’</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_98">[Pg 98]</span></p>

<p>‘I did. Everyone who knew him knew
her. What of it? Are you getting up
a little jealousy of the dead for future use?’</p>

<p>‘Don’t talk nonsense. Am I the sort
of woman to go raving mad on account
of my husband’s former peccadilloes? But
what became of her?’</p>

<p>At this juncture Nell became keenly
attentive. She thrust her head as far
as she dared out of the window, and did
not lose a single word.</p>

<p>‘By Jove! no,’ laughed Portland, ‘I
cannot imagine your ladyship being jealous
of anything, or anyone who had not the
power to take your beloved coronet from
you. But surely you know what became
of the poor girl? She is dead. She
drowned herself when Ilfracombe sent
home word that he was about to marry
you, and told old Sterndale to give her
“the genteel kick out.”’</p>

<p>‘Poor child,’ said the countess, compassionately,
‘it was very terrible, if true.
But what proofs were there of her doing
so? Was the body ever found?’</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_99">[Pg 99]</span></p>

<p>‘I believe not. But don’t talk of it,
please. I had a sincere regard for Miss
Llewellyn, and the thought of her dreadful
end makes me sad.’</p>

<p>‘<em>You</em> feeling for anyone of your fellow-creatures,
Jack?’ replied Nora incredulously.
‘You must have been very hard
hit. But I really want to know if there
was any doubt of her death. I have a
particular reason for asking.’</p>

<p>‘I heard there was no doubt. That is
all I can tell you, Lady Ilfracombe.’</p>

<p>‘What was she like, Jack?’ urged
Nora.</p>

<p>‘Very handsome indeed, more than handsome,
beautiful; with the most glorious
golden chesnut hair imaginable, and large
hazel eyes, with dark brows and lashes,
and a straight nose and good mouth and
chin. A lovely figure, too, tall and graceful,
though with large hands and feet.
A remarkable-looking young woman, Nora,
and it is a feather in your cap to have
driven her memory so completely from
Ilfracombe’s heart.’</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_100">[Pg 100]</span></p>

<p>‘But I am not sure that I <em>have</em> driven
it. Ilfracombe is very touchy on the
subject now, and cannot bear her name
to be mentioned. But I tell you what,
Jack, she is no more dead than I am,
for I have seen her.’</p>

<p>‘My God! Where?’ exclaimed Mr
Portland excitedly.</p>

<p>‘Why, in this very house. Don’t you
remember Sir Archibald telling us that
the young woman who stopped Lady
Bowmant’s cobs must have been one of
the Llewellyns? I came over here the
same afternoon to see her and thank her
more particularly than I had been able
to do, and if the girl I saw is not Nell
Llewellyn, I’ll eat my hat. She answers
to your description exactly.’</p>

<p>‘You don’t mean to say so! It never
entered into my calculations. I had made
so sure that she was gone. Have you
mentioned your suspicions to Ilfracombe?’</p>

<p>‘No fear. I’m not such a fool as I
look. Why should I raise up all the old
feelings in him, just as he is settling<span class="pagenum" id="Page_101">[Pg 101]</span>
down so nicely with me? But I should
like to know it is true, and to know for
certain. It is a dreadful thing to have
a girl’s death at one’s door. So I thought
I would tell you, and you could find
out for me.’</p>

<p>‘I will make a point of doing so, but
I’m afraid you are labouring under a
mistake. There was so little doubt of
Miss Llewellyn’s death. The young woman
you have seen may be a sister, or other
relation. It is worth while inquiring.’</p>

<p>‘But don’t compromise Ilfracombe in doing
so. He particularly begged me not
to mention his name when I called here,
in case they might be of the same family.
But I mustn’t stay longer, Jack, so please
let me have the letters.’</p>

<p>‘All right. But you must come and
fetch them.’</p>

<p>‘Well, I am here, safe enough.’</p>

<p>‘Perhaps, but the letters are not here.
They are in my despatch-box in my
room.’</p>

<p>‘Go and bring them then.’</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_102">[Pg 102]</span></p>

<p>‘The bargain was that <em>you</em> were to
fetch them, Nora.’</p>

<p>‘But not to enter your room, Jack. I
cannot do that. It is impossible. I
refuse.’</p>

<p>‘Then you can’t fetch the letters, my
lady.’</p>

<p>‘And have you brought me here to
play me such an unfair trick as that? You
knew that I could not enter your room?
It would be risking the happiness of my
whole future life. Supposing Mr Lennox
were to return suddenly, and find me
closeted there with you? You want to
ruin me. I shall do no such thing.’</p>

<p>‘You know now that you are only
quibbling, Nora—only fighting with the
inevitable. You will not rest till you
have those letters in your own hands.
You have told me you would give half
your fortune to get them, and yet you
refuse to pass the threshold of my room.
What nonsense. You must devise some
others means by which to procure them
then, for I will not go back from my<span class="pagenum" id="Page_103">[Pg 103]</span>
word. I said you should have them if
you would fetch them, and now that they
are within your reach, you refuse to stretch
out your hand and take them. Very well,
it is not my fault. You must return
without them.’</p>

<p>Nora thought a minute, and then said,—</p>

<p>‘What time is it?’</p>

<p>‘Half-past twelve,’ replied her companion.
‘They will not break up over
there for another hour and a half.’</p>

<p>She knew she was as much within this
man’s power as if he held the proofs of
some great crime which she had committed.
She did not exactly remember what her
foolish letters to him contained; but she
was sure there was sufficient love-sick folly
in them which, aided by his inuendoes,
and even falsehoods, might bring everlasting
disgrace upon her, to say nothing of
Ilfracombe’s serious displeasure which she
dreaded still more. To lose her husband’s
trust and confidence and respect—perhaps
his love—was too terrible a contingency
in the young countess’s eyes. She had<span class="pagenum" id="Page_104">[Pg 104]</span>
been guilty of a fearful social error in
going to the farm at all; she knew that,
but now she was there, would it not be
better to comply with Jack Portland’s
conditions, hard as they might be, than
to return to the Hall, having played her
<i>escapade</i> for nothing.</p>

<p>‘Where are the letters?’ was the next
question she asked him.</p>

<p>‘I have told you. In my despatch-box.’</p>

<p>‘But where is the box?’</p>

<p>‘On a table just within the door.’</p>

<p>‘Will you go in first and get them out,
and then I will cross the threshold and
take them from you.’</p>

<p>‘Are you so terribly afraid of me as all
that, Nora?’</p>

<p>‘Not afraid of you or any man,’ she
answered haughtily, ‘but afraid of compromising
my good name. It is too fearful
a risk. Anything might happen. Mr
Lennox might return, or the people of the
house come down, or—or— Oh, Jack, if
you ever loved me the least little bit,
don’t ask me to do more than I have done.’</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_105">[Pg 105]</span></p>

<p>He appeared to be satisfied with her
excuse, for Nell saw him leave her side
and disappear into the house. In another
minute the countess, who had stood looking
anxiously after him, seemed to have
received his signal, for she cautiously followed
him. Then there was a silence of
several minutes, during which Nell listened
eagerly to hear what passed, but no sound
reached her ear. The next thing she saw
was the figure of Lady Ilfracombe, who left
the house hurriedly, and, throwing herself
down on the grass, burst into tears. It
was a rare occurrence for Nora to lose
command of herself, but to-night she felt
utterly worsted and broken down. She
had built so many fair hopes on this
venture, and now she found herself as far
from obtaining her wishes as ever.</p>

<p>‘You are <em>a brute</em>!’ she exclaimed, as
Jack Portland joined her; ‘a false and
merciless brute! You have lured me here
under false pretences, and in order to get
me only more surely in your toils. You
knew you were deceiving me—you knew<span class="pagenum" id="Page_106">[Pg 106]</span>
the letters were not there—you persuaded
me to enter your room against all my
better judgment, in order that I may compromise
myself, and be more your slave
than before. But there must be an end
put to it some day. I will not go on being
laughed at by you for ever. I defy you
to do your worst. Show Ilfracombe those
letters, as you have so often threatened,
and I will take good care the day you do
so is the last you ever spend under any
roof of mine.’</p>

<p>‘Softly, softly, my lady,’ said Portland;
‘aren’t you going a little too fast, and
making a little too much noise over this
business? I give you my word of honour
that I fully believed that interesting packet
of letters was in my despatch-box.’</p>

<p>‘Your word of <em>honour</em>!’ repeated Nora,
disdainfully, as she rose from her despairing
attitude and stood up, wiping her wet
eyes; ‘how long have you possessed the
article?’</p>

<p>‘Now, Nora, none of your sneers, if you
please,’ said Jack Portland; ‘don’t be foolish,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_107">[Pg 107]</span>
and make a regular quarrel of this
matter. Let me tell you this—that so long
as you insult me on every occasion I shall
never give you back those letters. After
all, they are legally mine, and you have
no right to demand their restoration. If I
return them, it will be as a favour; and
people do not, as a rule, grant favours to
ladies who call them liars and scoundrels
and cheats for their pains. And now, had
you not better go back to the Hall? I
have shown you what I can do by bringing
you here, and I don’t mean to do
anything more for you to-night. When
you have learned how to coax and wheedle
a little, instead of bully and storm, perhaps
you may persuade me to give you back
those much-longed-for letters.’</p>

<p>The countess seemed to be perfectly
subdued. To those who knew her as she
generally was, and especially to the man
before her, the change in her voice and
demeanour would have seemed a marvel.</p>

<p>‘Yes, I will go,’ she replied in a meek
tone; ‘but I should like to have a few<span class="pagenum" id="Page_108">[Pg 108]</span>
words with you first, Jack. I cannot think
what has changed you so; but you are not
the same man you were at Malta. Still,
I do not think you can have quite forgotten
that time when we first met, and
thought we loved each other. It was my
father, Sir Richard Abinger, who separated
us, as you know well, and even if he had
not done so, I do not think you would
have wished to marry me, for you had no
income, and I should only have been a
great burden to you. So, is it quite fair,
do you think, to visit the fact of our parting
on my head, especially now that I am
married to another man? Those letters of
mine—written to you when I considered
we were engaged lovers—I daresay they
are very silly and spooney, and full of the
nonsense people generally write under such
circumstances; but I cannot think there is
anything compromising in them, as you
would lead me to believe. I feel sure, if I
were to show them to my husband, he
would forgive and absolve me from all
thought of wrong. But will you not spare<span class="pagenum" id="Page_109">[Pg 109]</span>
me such an act of self-humiliation? Cannot
you be man enough to forgive a girl
who has never done you any harm for
having caused you a little mortification?
Will you not do so—for the sake of Malta
and the time when you thought you loved me?’</p>

<p>Nora’s voice was so sorrowful, and yet
so full of dignity, as she pronounced these
words, that Nell’s heart burned within her
to listen to them, and she longed to have
the power to steal those letters and restore
them to her, spite of all Mr Jack Portland’s
machinations. And as she sat there she
clenched her hands together and said to
herself that if it were to be done she
would do it. She had not been unmindful
of Nora’s kindness when she visited her
under the guise of Mrs Lumley, though she
had so ill-requited it, and now that she
knew who she was, and that it was Ilfracombe’s
unloved wife who had had her
ring and money flung back in her face,
Nell’s generous nature asserted itself, and
she inwardly vowed that if she could do
her a good turn she would.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_110">[Pg 110]</span></p>

<p>‘Why are you so very anxious to get
these letters back, especially if there’s
nothing in them?’ asked Mr Portland.
‘It’s not because you’re so deuced fond of
Ilfracombe that you tremble for his peace
of mind surely? You’ve got your coronet
out of him, and what on earth do you
want more? You are not going to stuff
me up with any humbug about your having
fallen in love with him, because I sha’n’t
believe it if you do. You married him for
a settlement—you never left him alone
till you had hooked him—and now you’ve
got the poor gull fast, what harm can
that little packet of letters do him, or
you, even if I should take it into my
head some day to bring you to order by
showing them to him, eh?’</p>

<p>Even in the dim light of the starless
sky Nell could see the countess twisting
her lace handkerchief nervously about in
her hands as she answered her tormentor.</p>

<p>‘Yes, you are right. I married Ilfracombe
because I thought it a fine thing
to become a countess, and to be presented<span class="pagenum" id="Page_111">[Pg 111]</span>
at Court and have a large fortune and
everything that I could require. But
I don’t feel like that now. I—I—love
him.’</p>

<p>‘<em>You love him!</em>’ echoed Portland, with
a coarse laugh; ‘that’s the best joke I
ever heard in my life. Do you suppose
he cares for you? Why, he only married
you because his people were always after
him to get rid of poor Miss Llewellyn,
and settle down respectably.’</p>

<p>‘Oh, no, no, don’t say that!’ cried the
countess in a tone of unmistakable
anguish.</p>

<p>‘But I do say it, and I could bring forward
dozens of fellows to corroborate my statement.
Ilfracombe adored Nell Llewellyn—so
did she him. Do you suppose she
would have committed suicide else?
Would <em>you</em> risk your precious life, or still
more precious coronet, for any man on
earth?’</p>

<p>‘Yes, I could—for Ilfracombe,’ she
answered tremblingly.</p>

<p>‘I can put all that in my eye and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_112">[Pg 112]</span>
see none the worse,’ continued Portland;
‘but, at any rate, your devotion is thrown
away. His lordship cares more for Miss
Llewellyn’s memory than he does for your
living self. You may represent his station
in life to him—perhaps, his prospective
family—but <em>she</em> was his love.’</p>

<p>‘You are very cruel to me,’ faltered
Nora, ‘though perhaps I have deserved
your contempt and irony. But no one
could live with Ilfracombe and not love
him. He is so generous—so considerate—so
unselfish, that a woman would be
insensible to every good influence not
to feel grateful to him in return. And
as for poor Miss Llewellyn, you are mistaken
if you imagine you have been the
first to tell me of his esteem for her,
and sorrow for her untimely loss. He
has told me all about it himself, and I
have sympathised deeply with him. My
husband has no secrets from me, as I
earnestly desire not to have any from
him. Were it not for these unfortunate
letters I should have none. But you<span class="pagenum" id="Page_113">[Pg 113]</span>
have tortured me too far, Jack. I throw
up the sponge. I shall tell Ilfracombe
on the first opportunity of the boasted
hold you have over me, and beg him to
end it one way or the other. Let him
read the letters and do his worst. It
can never be as bad as yours. You
have made my married life a torment to
me by your unmanly threats.’</p>

<p>She turned away from him as she concluded,
and commenced to toil up the
steep acclivity that led to the gate. But
Jack Portland sprang after her.</p>

<p>‘I am not going to let you go alone,’
he said. ‘Come, Nora, let us part better
friends than this. Forgive me for being
a little amused at the idea of you and
old Ilfracombe having a quiet “spoon”
together, and trust me that he shall never
trace any annoyance that may accrue
from your former little follies to my
door.’</p>

<p>The countess did not appear to make
any answer to this harangue, and Nell
watched them ascend the hill together<span class="pagenum" id="Page_114">[Pg 114]</span>
and pass out of the white
gate.</p>

<p>‘And how long is Jack Portland to be
trusted?’ she thought, as they disappeared.
‘Just as long as it suits him, and then he will
hold his unmanly threats over that poor
woman’s head again. Well, I’ve no particular
reason to love her, heaven knows,
but I can do her this kindness in return
for hers, and I will, if only to keep <em>his</em>
name unstained by the tongue of such
a scoundrel as Jack Portland. They have
gone to the Hall, and he will probably
not be back for another hour. Now’s the
time? If I wait till daylight mother will
be about, and liable to break in upon me
at any moment. I will slip down at
once.’</p>

<p>She lighted a taper, and, shading it
with her hand, crept softly down the
stairs that led to the bricked passage,
and so into the lodgers’ rooms. That
occupied by Mr Portland lay to the left.
The door was ajar. Nell had only to
push it gently open in order to enter.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_115">[Pg 115]</span>
She set her light down on a table and
glanced around her. All was in perfect
order, except the much-talked-of dispatch-box,
which had been left open
with its contents tumbled over. Nell did
not believe that the packet of letters
was not there. It was very unlikely that
Jack Portland would not know what was
in his box, or what was not. He had
intended to hand it to the countess, but
changed his mind at the last moment.
She looked carefully through the contents
of the box, but found no packet. She
had replaced the papers carefully, and
was about to search the remainder of
the apartment, when, to her horror, she
heard a footstep enter the narrow passage
that divided the two rooms and approach
the one which she occupied. It was useless
to extinguish her light. The newcomer
had already perceived her.</p>

<p>‘Halloa!’ he exclaimed, ‘and what
pretty burglar have I here?’</p>

<p>She turned to confront him, and his
tone changed to one of terror.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_116">[Pg 116]</span></p>

<p>‘My God, <em>Nell</em>!’ he cried, ‘are you
dead or living?’</p>

<p>She stood face to face with Jack
Portland.</p>

</div>


<p class="unindent">‘<span class="smcap">Are</span> you living,’ he repeated, ‘or—or—dead?’</p>

<p>In the excitement of his subsequent
conversation with Lady Ilfracombe he
had forgotten the suspicions she had communicated
to him with regard to this
woman, and now stood before her, dazed
and trembling. Men who are given to
drinking are always terribly afraid of the
supernatural.</p>

<p>‘Don’t alarm yourself,’ replied Nell
scornfully, ‘I am alive.’</p>

<p>‘<em>Alive!</em> Then Lady Ilfracombe was
correct when she assured me she had
met you. Though she had never seen
you before, your description tallied so
exactly with the girl she saw here that
she felt certain you must be the same
person.’</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_118">[Pg 118]</span></p>

<p>‘She was right,’ said Nell quietly.</p>

<p>‘And how did it all happen?’ asked
Jack Portland eagerly. ‘You will forgive
my curiosity, when you remember that
your death was not only currently reported,
but, as it was supposed, proved
beyond a doubt. We—that is, Ilfracombe
and all your friends—felt your loss very
much. It was terrible for us to think
you had come to so sad an end. You
will believe so much, will you not?’</p>

<p>‘Oh, yes.’</p>

<p>‘But you are standing, Miss Llewellyn;
pray sit down. You will not be afraid
to bestow a few moments on me in order
to satisfy my great curiosity. Tell me
first, how is it we find you here?’</p>

<p>‘That is easily accounted for, Mr Portland.
Usk is my native place. I was
born at Panty-cuckoo Farm. Mr and Mrs
Llewellyn are my father and mother. So
it was only natural, when I lost the home
I thought was mine, that I should return
to them.’</p>

<p>‘But how was it that the rumour of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_119">[Pg 119]</span>
your death became so widely circulated?’</p>

<p>‘Oh, don’t talk of that,’ she said
wearily. ‘I <em>did</em> throw myself into the
water. I thought it would be better for
all concerned, myself especially; but some
well-meaning people pulled me out again,
and when I found that the world believed
me to be gone, I thought it just as well
not to undeceive it. That is all. Of
course I had no idea you would ever
come here, or meet me again. As it is,
all I wish is that you should leave Usk
without betraying my secret to my
parents.’</p>

<p>‘You may depend on me, Miss Llewellyn,’
said Portland. ‘But does Ilfracombe
know of your proximity?’</p>

<p>A gleam of pleasure lighted up her
features.</p>

<p>‘Yes. I met him yesterday, quite by
accident, and he was as surprised to see
me as you are. But he was glad—very
glad.’</p>

<p>(‘Hullo!’ thought Jack to himself;<span class="pagenum" id="Page_120">[Pg 120]</span>
‘then this accounts for his sudden determination
to go?’)</p>

<p>But aloud he said,—</p>

<p>‘Of course he would be, as we all are.
And now, may I ask what you were
doing in my room, Miss Llewellyn?’</p>

<p>‘Yes,’ she answered boldly. ‘I came
down here in your absence to see if I
could find the packet of letters which you
refused to give to Lady Ilfracombe.’</p>

<p>‘The packet of letters!’ he exclaimed,
completely startled out of his usual prudence.
How can you know anything
about her letters? Who can have told
you?’</p>

<p>‘No one has told me. My bedroom
window is up there, and I overheard you
talking to her to-night. I did not miss a
single word of your conversation.’</p>

<p>‘By George!’ cried Portland. ‘Well,
then, there would be no use in my disguising
the matter. She has been a
horrid little flirt; but there’s no harm
about her now. Understand that plainly.’</p>

<p>‘Then why did you tempt her to meet<span class="pagenum" id="Page_121">[Pg 121]</span>
you here to-night? You must know what
a rupture it would make between her and
the earl if it became known?’</p>

<p>‘I shall take good care it does not get
known. But I want to pay her out for
her past conduct to me. She is the sort
of lady that it is as well to keep the whip
hand over.’</p>

<p>‘When you want to make money out
of her husband. Yes; I understand perfectly.
So you have not let poor Ilfracombe
out of your clutches yet, Mr Portland.
How much longer is he to be
fleeced?’</p>

<p>‘You speak boldly, Miss Llewellyn; but,
if I remember rightly, you always used to
do so.’</p>

<p>‘In <em>his</em> cause, yes.’</p>

<p>‘And so you meant to steal my property,
eh? and restore it to her ladyship?’</p>

<p>‘If it were possible. But I begin to
be afraid you spoke the truth when you said
the letters were not here. They are not in
the dispatch-box, at all events. Oh, Mr<span class="pagenum" id="Page_122">[Pg 122]</span>
Portland, if you have them, do give them
to me.’</p>

<p>‘In order that your heartless little rival—the
woman who has supplanted you
with Ilfracombe—may go scot-free? What
do you suppose she will do for you in
return? What she has already done—persuaded
her husband to leave Usk at
once. They go to-morrow!’</p>

<p>Nell drew a long breath.</p>

<p>‘To-morrow? Oh, that is soon. Nevertheless
let her have back her letters, Mr
Portland, if only in return for all the kindness
<em>he</em> has shown you. You could never
use them against her. It would be impossible;
and withholding them might urge
her on to confide the matter to her husband,
which would mean a break-up of
your long intimacy with him.’</p>

<p>‘By Jove! you are an eloquent pleader,
Nell!’ exclaimed her companion, looking
at her admiringly, ‘and there’s more good
in your little finger than in her ladyship’s
whole body. You’re doing this for Ilfracombe’s
sake, I can spot that fast enough;<span class="pagenum" id="Page_123">[Pg 123]</span>
but if you believe all her protestations
about loving him you are easily gulled.
She cares for no one but herself; she
never did; but she’s in a mortal fright
lest I should peach and make ructions
between them. Which there would be, I
can assure you, when I tell you that if it
were in my power, I would not marry
the woman who wrote such letters as I
have in my possession. By George! you
should see them. They would make
your eyes open. You would not have
written such epistles to save your life.’</p>

<p>‘Perhaps not,’ she answered quietly.
‘Letter-writing was never much in my
line. But if what you say is true, it is
all the more necessary that they should be
destroyed. Give them to me, Mr Portland,
I implore you, for the old time’s sake.’</p>

<p>‘Do you know what you are asking,
Miss Llewellyn? To be allowed to do
the best turn in your power (or the power
of anyone) to the woman who inveigled
Ilfracombe from you; to make a heartless,
reckless girl, who is only afraid of imperilling<span class="pagenum" id="Page_124">[Pg 124]</span>
her position in society, at her
ease for evermore; to set her free to
bamboozle some other man as she bamboozled
me.’</p>

<p>‘Oh, no, no. I do not believe that.
She loves her husband. You might hear
it in the very tone of her voice.’</p>

<p>‘<em>The very tone of her voice!</em>’ echoed
Jack Portland sneeringly. ‘What a judge
of character you must be. Why, Nora
Ilfracombe is a thorough actress, and can
change her voice at will. How Ilfracombe
can ever have been so infatuated as to
make her his countess beats me. And to
see him lolling on the sofa by her side, and
devouring her with his eyes is sickening.
He’s over head and ears in love with
her, and she wants to keep him at her
feet. That’s the long and the short of it.’</p>

<p>‘But you told her just now that it was
<em>I</em> whom he loved,’ cried Nell quickly.</p>

<p>‘Did I? That was only to make her
ladyship waxey. Ilfracombe has forgotten
all about you long ago—’</p>

<p>‘I—I—think you are mistaken,’ replied<span class="pagenum" id="Page_125">[Pg 125]</span>
Nell in a constrained tone; ‘but you cannot
blame the countess for wishing to keep
him as much with her as possible. And—and—since
it is all over for you and
me, Mr Portland—since you have lost
<em>her</em>, and I have lost <em>him</em>—would it not be
better and nobler to leave them alone
for the future, and put no obstacle in the
way of their happiness?’</p>

<p>‘And what would you do with the packet
of letters if I did deliver them over to you?’</p>

<p>‘I would take them to her at once and
give them her on the promise that she
would never be so foolish as to meet you
secretly again.’</p>

<p>‘And you think she would thank you—that
she would be grateful?’</p>

<p>‘<em>He</em> would, if he knew it,’ she replied.</p>

<p>‘Ah, it’s all for <em>him</em> still, though he cast
you off, like a worn-out glove. You women
are inexplicable creatures. It seems to me
that the worse you are treated the closer
you stick.’</p>

<p>‘Never mind that. Will you give me
the letters?’</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_126">[Pg 126]</span></p>

<p>‘I will, on one condition.’</p>

<p>‘What is it?’</p>

<p>‘Nell, do you remember what I said to
you once in Grosvenor Square and you were
so angry with me for saying? I knew then
that Ilfracombe was contemplating marriage,
and that you would be left without a home,
and I loved you. Yes, you may stare as
you like, but it is the truth. Such love
as it is in my nature to feel, I have felt,
and do feel, for you. I admire you—not
only personally, but your courage, your
pride, your determination. I admire the
ease with which you accepted your equivocal
position under Ilfracombe’s roof—the
humility with which you deferred to his
will, even when it came to leaving you alone
in London for four months whilst he gallivanted
after Miss Nora Abinger.’</p>

<p>‘Oh, spare me, Mr Portland, spare me!’
cried Nell,’let the past alone, it is too
painful a recollection to me. I know I was
furious with you. I had a right to be, but
my high spirits are all gone. If it were
so, I should not stay to listen now.’</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_127">[Pg 127]</span></p>

<p>‘But I am not going to say one word
that the most virtuous matron in England
might not hear. I repeat that you are the
only woman for whom I have ever experienced
any genuine feeling, and if you
really want to save your late friend from
a very painful humiliation (which will inevitably
come some day, by the exhibition
of those letters), I will give them to you to
do with as you will—if you will marry
me.’</p>

<p>‘<em>What?</em>’ she exclaimed, starting backward.</p>

<p>‘I mean what I say. I know that my
former proposal was a different one, but I
have altered my mind since them. I offer
to marry you—to give you my name, which
is, at all events, that of a gentleman, though
I’m afraid a rather shady one, and—Lady
Ilfracombe’s letters.’</p>

<p>‘But Mr Portland, you do not know what
you are asking. My heart is not the least
changed since those days. Ilfracombe’s
conduct—his marriage—have made no difference
to me. I wish they had. I wish<span class="pagenum" id="Page_128">[Pg 128]</span>
I had got over my trouble, and could go
to you, or any man, with a clear conscience
and say, “I love you.” But I cannot, I
never shall. My soul is bound up in that
of Ilfracombe. He is <em>my</em> husband—not that
woman’s. I think of him every day; pray
for him every night by that name. I
know he has deserted me, but I have
never deserted him, and there were reasons
in his case that made marriage a necessity.
It has not destroyed his love for me; that
is as true and strong as ever. And it
would be impossible to me, whilst his love
lasts, to be any other man’s wife.’</p>

<p>‘Who told you that Ilfracombe loves you
still—that is, if he ever loved you.’</p>

<p>‘He told me so himself, only last night
when we met in the meadow. He said
he wished he had married me when he felt
disposed to do it, years ago.’</p>

<p>‘If he said that, he’s a scoundrel and a
liar,’ cried Jack Portland.</p>

<p>‘Mr Portland, how dare you speak so?
No one shall call Lord Ilfracombe such
names in my presence. He was never<span class="pagenum" id="Page_129">[Pg 129]</span>
dishonest or untrue. He was always the
best and kindest and most generous of men
to me—just as you heard his wife say this
evening—and whoever speaks against him
must be my enemy.’</p>

<p>‘I am not that,’ replied Jack Portland.
‘Now, look here, Miss Llewellyn. The facts
are these: Ilfracombe, whatever he may have
said to you is simply infatuated with his
wife. He defers to her will—follows her
about like a lamb with a blue ribbon round
its neck—and obeys her in everything. No
one who sees him can help observing how
madly in love he is. That is my hold over
her. Ilfracombe loses a great deal of money
to me. I don’t deny it. His money is
useful to me, and it is in my power to ruin
him if I choose. Indeed I have done a
little that way already. Two years ago in
Malta I met his wife, then Nora Abinger,
and had a pretty hot flirtation with her.
There was no real harm in it, but there
was not much bloom left on the plum for
the next comer, and she compromised herself
in so many ways that no prejudiced person<span class="pagenum" id="Page_130">[Pg 130]</span>
would think our acquaintanceship had been
an innocent one. A case of circumstantial
evidence, certainly, but so are most cases
that end fatally for the actors in them.
Well, to speak plainly, this is how I stand
with the earl and countess. I could ruin
them both to-morrow if I chose, and it is
for you to render me harmless—draw the
dragon’s teeth, in fact, and transform him
into a lamb.’</p>

<p>Nell had grown very white as Portland
alluded to Ilfracombe’s affection for his wife,
but still she shook her head and repeated,—</p>

<p>‘I couldn’t—indeed, I couldn’t’</p>

<p>‘When I spoke to you last,’ persisted
Portland, ‘things were quite different. Then
you expected your lover to return to you any
day, and you were horrified at the idea of
stepping from one equivocal position to
another. Now all is changed. Ilfracombe
will never live with you again. You are
sure of that. He has left you unprotected,
and thrown you back upon a life for which he
unfitted you without any prospects for the
future—a ruined woman, yet with all the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_131">[Pg 131]</span>
instincts of a lady. And I offer you
marriage—an honest position if nothing else,
and a return to some of the luxuries of life
to which you have been so long accustomed.
Is it not worth thinking over?’</p>

<p>Nell looked at Jack Portland steadily.
She had always hated and despised him,
and never more so than at the present
moment—but he held the fate of Ilfracombe
in his hands. He could ruin his fortunes and
destroy his domestic happiness—and he put
it in her power to save him. What if she
could do it? Would it be a greater sacrifice
than flinging herself into the water had been?
Could it be a crueller fate than that which
she endured now? Could anything—even
marriage with Jack Portland, prove more
bitter than her present existence and the
bare outlook for the future?</p>

<p>‘What security would you give me—in
case of my complying with your proposal—that
my sacrifice would not be wasted,
that you would not continue to lead Ilfracombe
into extravagance and folly until you
had ruined him?’</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_132">[Pg 132]</span></p>

<p>‘Your best security would lie in the possession
of her ladyship’s letters,’ was the
reply. ‘She has such a wholesome dread
of my producing them at present that she
dares not influence her husband to give
up my acquaintance. But Madam Nora
hates me too genuinely to delay setting
her own machinery in motion one minute
after she knows she has no more to fear
from me. Set your mind at ease on that
score, Miss Llewellyn. The whole matter
lies in a nutshell—my possession of those
letters. They are the locks of Samson—the
heel of Achilles. Once take them
out of my hands and I am powerless to
harm—my vulnerable spot is found.’</p>

<p>‘Tell me all your conditions,’ continued
Nell in a low voice.</p>

<p>Jack Portland’s eyes glistened as he exclaimed
eagerly,—</p>

<p>‘They shall not be difficult ones, my
dear. If you will consent to come with
me and be married at the registrar’s
office the letters are yours.’</p>

<p>‘No, no, I will not trust you, Mr<span class="pagenum" id="Page_133">[Pg 133]</span>
Portland. I must have the letters
first.’</p>

<p>‘I have greater faith than you have.
I believe I <em>can</em> trust you. You are too
noble a woman to deceive me.’</p>

<p>‘If I say I will marry you I will marry
you. You may rely on that. My worst
enemies never called me a liar. But I promise
nothing more.’</p>

<p>‘I ask for nothing more,’ replied Mr
Portland. ‘Come, I will make a bargain
with you, Nell. I will ride into Newport
to-morrow morning and get the licence.
We must give them twenty-four hours’
notice; and the next day we will be
married, and as soon as the ceremony is
over the letters shall be placed in your
hand. Will that satisfy you?’</p>

<p>‘No; I must be allowed to examine
them first, to make sure they are the
original ones, and I must have your attestation
in writing that you have never
received any others from Miss Abinger,
and that if at any time such should crop
up they will be forgeries. Else how can<span class="pagenum" id="Page_134">[Pg 134]</span>
I be sure that it—it—might not all be in
vain?’</p>

<p>‘You know how to drive a hard bargain,
Nell, but I agree. Give me yourself,
and I am willing to give up everything
on earth in exchange. So it is a bargain
then. To-morrow, or rather to-day (for
the dawn is breaking), is Thursday, and
to-morrow, Friday, will be our wedding
day.’</p>

<p>‘An unlucky day,’ said Nell, with a
slight shiver. ‘But I have not promised
yet. You must give me till this afternoon
to think it over, Mr Portland. It has
been too hurried a proposal.’</p>

<p>‘Oh, come, I say, that’s too bad. You’ve
as good as said you’d consent. I’m in
downright earnest, Nell, ‘pon my soul I
am, and as far as in me lies I’ll make you
a good husband. Now don’t be afraid.
I know you never had a great opinion of
me, but I’m going to reform now, on my
word I am, and turn over a new leaf if
you’ll only help me. Come now, say it’s a
settled thing.’</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_135">[Pg 135]</span></p>

<p>‘Not till this afternoon,’ she reiterated.
‘Be here at two o’clock, and I will give
you my final answer then. But only under
the conditions I have named. I must have
the letters beforehand to examine, and the
assurance that you have kept none of
them back, and then you shall deliver
them to me in the registrar’s office. On
no other terms will I meet you there.’</p>

<p>‘All right, I agree to them. But now
you had better go, or Lennox may come
rushing in. Good-night. Are you not going
to kiss me before you leave?’</p>

<p>Nell shook her head.</p>

<p>‘There will be time for that afterwards,’
she said gravely. ‘And don’t forget, Mr
Portland, that I have held back nothing
from you to-night, and that I come to you
with no disguise. You have seen into
my heart. If you elect to buy an empty
casket don’t blame the seller.’</p>

<p>‘I shall blame no one and nothing,’ he
replied. ‘I am only too pleased to get
you on any terms. I see you do not
believe me when I say I love you, and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_136">[Pg 136]</span>
have loved you all along. You think such
a word from my lips a sacrilege, but still
it is true, and I shall try to make you
love me in return. I am a wild, reckless,
perhaps dishonourable fellow, but I
have one soft spot in my heart, and that
is for you. I shall be here without fail
at two o’clock this afternoon. Mind you
have your answer ready. And mark you,
Nell,’ he continued rather fiercely, ‘if it is
“No” the fate of the Ilfracombes is sealed.
I shall not be able to bear the disappointment.
I shall lay it at his door, and I
will take my revenge without delay. You
understand?’</p>

<p>‘Yes, perfectly. And I <em>think</em> my answer
will not be “No.”’</p>

<p>She passed away through the narrow
passage as she spoke, and Jack Portland
stood and watched her disappear with a
new feeling in his heart.</p>

<p>As for Nell, when she had reached the
sanctuary of her own room, her thoughts
were not of this extraordinary engagement
to marry—so suddenly and unexpectedly<span class="pagenum" id="Page_137">[Pg 137]</span>
entered into, and with all men in the
world, Jack Portland—she did not think
of the sacrifice she was about to make,
and for her rival, Lady Ilfracombe. No,
her whole mind was bent on solving one
question, the only thing which affected
her in the whole transaction—did Lord
Ilfracombe really love his wife, as Mr
Portland said he did? What incomprehensible
animals women are! She loved
this man with her whole soul. She desired
his happiness and welfare above all
earthly things. She had been ready to
throw her life away when she heard he
had deserted her. She was ready now,
for his sake, and to save the honour of his
name, to take upon herself a marriage
the very thought of which she loathed
and abhorred; but she could not bear the
idea that he was happier in his love for
his wife than he had been with her, that
he had forgotten, in fact, the days which
they had spent together, or was glad that
they were gone. Her inward cry still was,
‘Tell me you love me best of all the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_138">[Pg 138]</span>
world, and the other woman can have your
title and your money.’</p>

<p>To hear Jack Portland expatiating on the
earl’s infatuation for his countess had been
the bitterest thing Nell had yet been called
upon to bear—the motive which had made
her consent, against her will, to become his
wife. But yet she did not quite believe it.
She recalled Ilfracombe’s affectionate words
of the evening before, his pleasure at meeting
her again, his regret that he had not
done the right thing by her years before,
and was resolved to know the truth for
herself before she finally sealed her fate by
consenting to Mr Portland’s proposal. As
she cogitated thus, all in a cold tremble
and flutter, Nell came to the desperate resolve
to seek an interview with the earl,
and tell him of this proposal, and ask his
advice whether she should marry or not.
Then she should see, she said to herself,
by his look, his manner, his sorrow or his
joy, if he loved her still. But he would
not let her marry, she felt certain of that,
and smiled as she thought of it; but then<span class="pagenum" id="Page_139">[Pg 139]</span>
the letters, those fatal letters, what would
become of him and the countess if she declined?
She sat by the window until it
was time to dress herself anew without
being able to arrive at any satisfactory conclusion.</p>

<p class="unindent"><span class="smcap">When</span> she descended to the parlour her
father and mother were already seated
at the breakfast-table. To her courteous
‘good-morning’ they vouchsafed no reply.
They were evidently still displeased with
her for her rebellion of the night before.
Nell went up to the farmer’s side and laid
her hand on his.</p>

<p>‘Father,’ she said in a trembling voice,
‘I have been thinking over what you
asked me yesterday, and I am willing to
do as you say. I will go to Lord Ilfracombe
and ask him to intercede with Sir
Archibald Bowmant about the raising of
your rent.’</p>

<p>This avowal changed the manner of both
the old people at once.</p>

<p>‘That’s my good lass!’ exclaimed her<span class="pagenum" id="Page_141">[Pg 141]</span>
mother. ‘I knew you wouldn’t hold out
against father and me for long.’</p>

<p>‘Well done, Nell!’ replied Mr Llewellyn;
‘and you’ll succeed, my girl, for
it’s few men, be they lords or ploughboys,
that would like to refuse anything to a
face like yours.’</p>

<p>‘Lor’! father, don’t go puffing the maid
up on her good looks,’ cried his wife.
‘Handsome is as handsome does; that’s
my motto. But I don’t think his lordship
will refuse her all the same; for he
was rare generous to her whilst she was
in service. Ah, Nell, ’twas the foolishest
thing as you ever did to chuck up that
place. You might find out, whilst you’re
about it, if there should happen to be
a vacancy in her ladyship’s house
now.’</p>

<p>‘All right, mother,’ said Nell gently;
and then, drawing a letter from her pocket,
she continued—‘I wrote this note to Lord
Ilfracombe last night, father; and, if you
approve it, you might send it over to the
Hall by Tom.’</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_142">[Pg 142]</span></p>

<p>She unfolded the paper and read,—</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>‘<span class="smcap">My Lord</span>,—My father wishes that I
should speak to you on a matter important
to himself. If it should be quite convenient,
will your lordship send word by
the bearer at what hour this morning I
could have a few minutes’ conversation
with you?—Yours respectfully,</p>

<p class="right">
‘<span class="smcap">E. Llewellyn</span>.’<br>
</p>
</div>

<p>‘A very proper note,’ said her mother
approvingly.</p>

<p>‘Ay, and don’t our Nell write a neat
hand?’ put in the farmer. ‘You’re a rare
scholar, Nell, though I don’t know where
you got it; for Hetty, who had the same
advantages, can’t do more than manage
a few words, and them not legible. It’ll
do rarely, my lass, and is just the thing
I wanted. His lordship can’t refuse so
simple a request. I’ll send Tom over
with it at once.’ And he rose from the
table for the purpose.</p>

<p>‘Come now, my girl, sit down, do, and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_143">[Pg 143]</span>
eat your breakfast,’ quoth Mrs Llewellyn,
seeing that her daughter still lingered by
the window.</p>

<p>‘No, thank you, mother. I don’t feel
like eating this morning. I wrote the
letter because I don’t like to cross father,
but I’ve a faint heart about it. The earl
may not like to be worried now he is
out for a holiday, and I’d be loath to
make him angry.’</p>

<p>‘Nonsense, Nell. He must be a cranky
fellow if a little note like yours would
put him out. He can but say, “No,”
lass, and then there’ll be no harm done.
But if you hadn’t writ it, father would
likely have always thought you might
have saved the rent if you’d a mind to,
so it’s just as well to humour him.
Come, take your tea, or I’ll be angry.’</p>

<p>The girl drank the cup of tea which
her mother handed her, and took up her
station again by the window.</p>

<p>If he should be angry, she thought;
or if he should be engaged and unable
to see her, how could she face the other<span class="pagenum" id="Page_144">[Pg 144]</span>
without knowing the worst, or the best?
And if the best, what then? Her life
seemed to have become a tangled coil
which she had no power of unravelling.
In about half an hour she saw the hedger,
Tom, shambling down the dell with a white
envelope in his hands. She rushed forward
feverishly to intercept him. It was
stamped with the earl’s coronet. Nell
tore it open and devoured its contents.</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>‘<span class="smcap">My Dear Miss Llewellyn</span>,—If you will
be in Mrs Hody’s sitting-room at eleven
o’clock, I will come to you there for a
few minutes.—Yours faithfully,</p>

<p class="right">
‘<span class="smcap">Ilfracombe</span>.’<br>
</p>
</div>

<p>He would see her, then; she would see
him! All, for the moment, seemed bright
again.</p>

<p>Her parents were delighted with the
news.</p>

<p>‘There, now, what did I tell ye?’ said
Mr Llewellyn; ‘I knew no gentleman,
let alone a lord, would refuse to see a<span class="pagenum" id="Page_145">[Pg 145]</span>
servant as had done her duty by him.
You’ve done the job now, Nell, as sure
as a gun. The earl will persuade Sir
Archibald to lower the rent again, and
mother and me will feel we owe it all to
you. Give me a buss, lass! It’s summat
for a man to have such a handsome
daughter to boast of. They may say as
beauty’s deceitful, but it beats brains any
day. You’ve saved the old farm to us,
my girl, and I’m thankful to you for it.’</p>

<p>‘I’ll do my best, dear father,’ said Nell;
‘but you mustn’t make too sure. The
earl, with all the good-will in the world,
may not have the power, but I’m sure
he’ll try to get it done.’</p>

<p>‘And when did you ever hear of a lord
trying for anything that didn’t succeed?’
exclaimed her mother; ‘it isn’t as if he
was a nobody! But come, my lass, you
mustn’t go up to the Hall in that soiled
dress. You’ve a clean print in your
drawers, so go and put it on, and make
your hair tidy. It looks as if you’d been
up all night.’</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_146">[Pg 146]</span></p>

<p>And the old woman bundled her daughter
upstairs to look after her wardrobe.</p>

<p>‘Now, where did you put that nasty
poison?’ she asked, as they entered the
bedroom together.</p>

<p>‘Where you told me, mother; on the
top of the wardrobe,’ answered Nell.</p>

<p>‘Have you written a label for it yet?’</p>

<p>‘No; I forgot to do so.’</p>

<p>‘Well, don’t you put it off another
day,’ replied Mrs Llewellyn; ‘for father was
quite vexed with me for letting the bottle
go out of my hands. He says a wineglassful
of that stuff would kill the
strongest man in Monmouth.’</p>

<p>‘No one can get at it there,’ said Nell,
quietly.</p>

<p>‘That’s all right then, but I shouldn’t
like for there to be an accident with it.
Here, Nell, tie this blue silk handkerchief
round your throat. You always
look so nice in blue, I think.’</p>

<p>Nell assented passively to all her
mother’s propositions, and, putting a straw
hat on her head, walked slowly up the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_147">[Pg 147]</span>
meadow and through the pine plantation,
to the private apartments of the housekeeper
at the Hall.</p>

<p>‘Well, Nell,’ said Mrs Hody when
she arrived there, ‘and so you’ve come
to have a private audience of his lordship.
He came to tell me he would see you
here at eleven o’clock, but as it was a
private matter, he did not wish to have
it discussed in the dining-room, so I was
to send him word quietly when you
arrived. And what can you have to say
to the earl, I wonder, as all the world
can’t hear?’</p>

<p>‘I asked to speak to Lord Ilfracombe
on some business connected with my
father, Mrs Hody,’ replied Nell, blushing;
‘he was my former master, you know,
or father would have come himself, but
he thought his lordship would rather see
me.’</p>

<p>‘Ah! well, I suppose it’s all right,’
responded the virtuous housekeeper; ‘but
I should have thought the study or the
gunroom would have been a fitter place.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_148">[Pg 148]</span>
However, now you’re here, please to sit
down, and I’ll go and tell his lordship
as you’re come. You may have to wait
a bit, I’m not sure as they’ve finished
breakfast, but he’ll be here, I suppose,
before long. Bless me, but you do look
dazed, Nell Llewellyn; that fever has run
you down terrible. Will you have a
glass of wine before I go?’</p>

<p>‘No thank you, Mrs Hody,’ replied the
girl, as she sat down in a chair and
leaned her aching head against the wall.
Mrs Hody bustled out of the room, and
it seemed ages to Nell before any one
came to join her. She heard voices and
laughter proceeding from the garden, and
many other sounds indicative of life and
enjoyment, but all about the housekeeper’s
domains, the intensest quiet seemed to
reign. At last it was broken by the
sound of a light quick footstep which
made Nell’s heart leap within her bosom,
coming along the stone passage, and in
another moment, the door opened and
closed, and Lord Ilfracombe stood before<span class="pagenum" id="Page_149">[Pg 149]</span>
her. Nell struggled to her feet to meet
him.</p>

<p>‘Oh! Vernie,’ were her first words;
‘it is not my fault.’</p>

<p>‘Hus—h’ said the earl, as he opened
the door again and listened to hear if
by any chance they could be overheard;
‘you mustn’t call me by that name, Nell,
lest any of the servants should have a
mind for eavesdropping.’</p>

<p>It was a small thing and a very natural
thing for him to say, but it fell on the
girl’s excited spirits like a cold douche.</p>

<p>‘I forgot, forgive me,’ she recommenced;
‘it was not my fault (I was going to
say) that you received that note,—my
lord. I would not have sent it to the
Hall on any account, but my father
fancied I might have some influence with
you in a certain matter, and insisted on
my asking to see you.’</p>

<p>‘It is all right,’ he said kindly; ‘only
we must keep to the business—you
understand.’</p>

<p>‘Oh! yes,’ she answered, with a catch in<span class="pagenum" id="Page_150">[Pg 150]</span>
her breath, ‘and it is soon told. My
father has been a tenant of Sir Archibald’s
for many years, twenty-five, I think, or
more, he has lived at Panty-cuckoo Farm
all his married life, and both I and my
sister were born there. Father has done
a great deal for the land, and spent a lot
of money on it, but Sir Archibald Bowmant
keeps raising the rent until he fears
it will be impossible for him to keep it
on, and he thought perhaps—father thought
that—<em>you</em> might be able to help him by
your influence with Sir Archibald.’</p>

<p>‘But I don’t quite understand,’ said the
earl; ‘what is it Mr Llewellyn wants me
to do, Nell?’</p>

<p>‘He fancied you might be able to remonstrate
with Sir Archibald, because it
is so unfair.’</p>

<p>Lord Ilfracombe looked grave.</p>

<p>‘I am sorry to refuse any request of
your father’s, but I really don’t see my
way to it. I am not a friend of Sir
Archibald’s, you see. I am quite a new
acquaintance, and I know nothing of his<span class="pagenum" id="Page_151">[Pg 151]</span>
monetary affairs. I am afraid he would
resent any interference on my part as a
liberty.’</p>

<p>‘I told father so, replied Nell, whose
eyes were fixed on the earl all the time.
‘I thought just the same myself, but he
was so obstinate. I did not know how to
refuse him, without—raising his suspicions.’</p>

<p>‘Ah—!’ replied Ilfracombe, thoughtfully,
‘<em>now</em>, don’t you see the imprudence of
refusing to accept any settlement at my
hands, Nell? You might have helped
your father in this emergency.’</p>

<p>‘Not with <em>your</em> money, Lord Ilfracombe,
given in such a cause. You don’t
know my father. He would have died
sooner than have taken it.’</p>

<p>‘Like his daughter,’ said the earl; ‘well,
you don’t know how unhappy you have
made me by refusing all assistance at my
hands; and since I met you the other
evening and learned that you were alive,
you have occupied all my thoughts, Nell.
I will tell you what I will do, if possible.
I will ask Sir Archibald Bowmant if he<span class="pagenum" id="Page_152">[Pg 152]</span>
will sell me Panty-cuckoo Farm, and if
he will part with the property, and I
become your father’s landlord, he need not
fear my raising the rent to him, I should feel
much more inclined to lower it. And then
some day, Nell, when you marry, as I have
done, you will let me settle the old farm on
you as a wedding present, and set my poor
conscience at rest for evermore, won’t you?’</p>

<p>Nell set her teeth hard together as she
replied,—</p>

<p>‘Would you like to see me married,
would it make you happier?’</p>

<p>There was not much need for him to
answer, the light that illumined his whole
face at the idea was sufficient answer.</p>

<p>‘Is there any chance of it?’ he asked
her, eagerly.</p>

<p>‘There is an excellent chance if I chose to
accept it. A man, a gentleman, who knows
the circumstances of my life, and so cannot
say afterwards that I have deceived him,
has made me an offer of marriage, though
I have not yet definitely accepted him.’</p>

<p>‘And do you like him, Nell? Will<span class="pagenum" id="Page_153">[Pg 153]</span>
he be kind to you?’ said Ilfracombe.
He would have liked to see her respectably
married, for whilst she lived as
she was doing now she was a constant
reproach to him, but, like all his sex,
though unwilling to accept the responsibility
himself, he did not <em>quite</em> like the
idea of any other man possessing what
had been his. But he stamped down the
feeling. It would decidedly be for the
best, he said to himself.</p>

<p>‘Does he love you? Would he be good
to you?’ he repeated anxiously.</p>

<p>‘He <em>says</em> he loves me,’ she answered
slowly, ‘and I shall take good care he is
not unkind to me.’</p>

<p>‘A man would be a brute who could be
unkind to you’ said the earl, with deep
feeling in his voice, ‘Nell, I think that
your illness has made you more beautiful
than ever. It has refined your whole
appearance. But this man—I am glad he
is a gentleman; you are not fit to be the
wife of a clown, and you can hold your
own with any lady in the land.’</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_154">[Pg 154]</span></p>

<p>‘So you advise me to marry him,’ she
said, raising her large liquid eyes to his face.</p>

<p>Ilfracombe remembered afterwards how
much they looked like the eyes of a
dumb animal that regard you patiently,
never mind what pain you may be putting
it to, but at the time he only saw their
pathetic beauty.</p>

<p>‘My dear girl,’ he replied, drawing
nearer to her, and taking her hand in
his; ‘how can I do otherwise than
advise you to accept this proposal, that
is if the fellow has enough to keep you
in a decent position of life. It is hard
for a woman to fight the world alone,
Nell. You are very beautiful, and the
world will look kindly on you whilst you
remain so; but beauty does not last for
ever, and when the evil days of old
age and perhaps penury come, it is well
for a woman if she is an honoured and
respected wife. You know I must feel
very deeply on this subject, for the
reason that <em>I</em>, in my reckless thoughtlessness,
have done so much to mar your<span class="pagenum" id="Page_155">[Pg 155]</span>
prospects of making a good marriage;
but if I find that, spite of all, you <em>do</em>
marry well, I shall be a very grateful
and a very happy man,’</p>

<p>‘If I knew that you would have no
regrets,’ said Nell, with white parched
lips; ‘if I were sure that you loved
your wife, and she loved you—’</p>

<p>‘Oh, if that assurance will make your
task easier, my poor Nell, let me give it
you,’ cried Ilfracombe; ‘and indeed I
am sure it is better in any case, since
everything between us two is over, that
we should understand each other perfectly
on that point. I <em>do</em> love my wife
with all my heart, and I hope—nay, I
believe she loves me almost as well.
You could hardly suppose that I should
have married her else—under the circumstances.
She had no money, no
particular birth, and no particular good
looks. What should I have married her
for, except for love? But she took me
completely by storm the first time I
met her, and I have been at her feet<span class="pagenum" id="Page_156">[Pg 156]</span>
ever since. So you need have no
scruples on that score. And I believe,
Nell—indeed, I feel sure that if you
were married, and especially to a gentleman,
Nora would prove a true friend to
you. She is a warm-hearted girl without
any affectation about her, and I told her
the history of our acquaintance, and she
was genuinely sorry for your fate. You
need fear nothing from Nora. She will
be as glad to hear you are happily
married as I shall be.’</p>

<p>‘That is enough,’ said Nell, in a low
voice, ‘that settles the matter my lord,
but I thought I should like to hear you
say so with your own lips first. The next
thing you will hear of will be my marriage.’</p>

<p>‘But when is it to be Nell, and what
is the happy man’s name?’ asked the
earl in quite a new voice, it was so
merry, and buoyant, and relieved.</p>

<p>‘Oh, you will know all that in good
time,’ replied the girl, trying to imitate
his cheerfulness; ‘it is not quite a settled
thing yet, but it will be soon now.’</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_157">[Pg 157]</span></p>

<p>‘And you will not refuse to take a
wedding present from me, Nell, for the
old times’ sake, will you?’ said Ilfracombe,
insinuatingly; ‘perhaps it may be
Panty-cuckoo Farm, who knows? If Sir
Archibald consents to part with it, and
then you will be your father’s landlord.
Wouldn’t that be funny? How surprised
the old people would be when you showed
them the title-deeds. And you will let
me have the very first intimation of the
event, won’t you?’</p>

<p>‘I will, my lord,’ said Nell, in a dull,
constrained tone.</p>

<p>‘No, no, Nelly, not that. I was only
obliged to caution you just now, because
the servants are so beastly curious in this
house. But we are quite alone, and you
must call me ‘Vernie’ again, just once
more, and kiss me as you used to do in
the old days.’</p>

<p>She turned and caught him passionately
to her breast, and murmured in his ear,
‘Vernie, Vernie. God bless you for
ever.’</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_158">[Pg 158]</span></p>

<p>‘God bless you Nell,’ he responded as
he kissed her heartily in return.</p>

<p>‘I am going now,’ she said presently
with trembling lips, ‘and we may not
meet again—not just yet. You offered
to do great things for me, Vernie, but I
would rather you were a friend to my
old father. If—if—anything should
happen to me, will you be kind to him
for my sake? Give him a little help if
he should need it, dear, or become his
landlord if possible, which would please
me better than anything.’</p>

<p>‘I will be his friend and yours, Nell,
to my life’s end,’ replied Ilfracombe; ‘and
if I cannot purchase Panty-cuckoo Farm,
and matters grow worse here, he shall
have one of my own farms in Huntingdonshire,
and be comfortable for the rest
of his days. But why do you say, “if
anything should happen to you?” What
should happen, my dear? You are getting
well and strong, and shall live to a hundred
years with your good man.’</p>

<p>‘Do you think so?’ replied the girl,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_159">[Pg 159]</span>
with a sad smile. ‘Well, if I do, my
parents shall owe their comfort to no
other hand than mine; and if I don’t,
you will not forget your promise to me.’</p>

<p>And before he could say another word
to her, she was gone. The two old people
were waiting her return with the greatest
anxiety, and exuberant were their rejoicings
when they heard the news she had to tell.
The earl had not only promised to try
and purchase Panty-cuckoo Farm, but had
said that in the event of his failure, he
would transplant them all to one of his own
farms in Huntingdonshire.</p>

<p>‘Ay,’ exclaimed the old man, ‘though
it’ll be a sore wrench to leave Panty-cuckoo,
it will be a fine thing to live
under his lordship’s tenancy. Sir Archibald,
he’s only an upstart when all’s said
and done. His father was the first baronet,
and it takes centuries to make ’em know
their places. He wouldn’t never have
thought of sweating the tenantry for to
pay his own rates and taxes, if he’s
been a thorough-bred ‘un, but I suppose<span class="pagenum" id="Page_160">[Pg 160]</span>
he knows no better. But the Earl of
Ilfracombe, why, of course, <em>he</em> knows how
to treat those that work to make the
prosperity of the country. He’s a real
aristocrat, born and bred, and wouldn’t
demean himself to raise a man’s rent to
pay for his own extravagances. Whatever
we might feel at leaving the old farm,
lass, I don’t know if we wouldn’t be wiser
to take his lordship’s offer at once, and
transplant all our goods and chattels to
Huntingdonshire.’</p>

<p>‘But you mustn’t do anything in a
hurry, father,’ exclaimed his wife, alarmed
by the rapidity of her good man’s ideas;
‘you must wait till we have word from
his lordship. But it’s a fine thing you
thought of sending our Nell over to the
Hall to speak with him. It’s made our
fortunes. We shall all be the better
for it, sha’n’t us, my lass?’</p>

<p>‘Yes, <em>all</em>,’ replied her daughter in a
dull tone, as if she were dreaming.</p>

<p>‘Now I declare girl, if you haven’t got
one of your muddly fits on again,’ said<span class="pagenum" id="Page_161">[Pg 161]</span>
Mrs Llewellyn. ‘If you spoke to his
lordship in that sort of way, I wonder
he ever listened to you. He must have
thought you were half asleep. It all
comes of your taking no breakfast. Who
ever heard of a healthy young woman
beginning the day on an empty stomach?
It’s absurd to think of such a thing.’</p>

<p>Nell went up to her mother, and kissed
her wrinkled forehead.</p>

<p>‘Never mind, mother,’ she said gently;
‘don’t grumble at me to-day, for I don’t
feel as if I could bear it. You shall think
better of me to-morrow, I promise
you.’</p>

<p>And she left the farmer and his wife to
congratulate each other on the possession
of so handsome a daughter, that no one
could find it in their hearts to refuse her
anything.</p>

<p>And Nell sat in her own room, thinking—thinking.
It was nearing the hour
when she had promised to give Mr Portland
her answer. He had agreed to come
to that place for it, and stand under her<span class="pagenum" id="Page_162">[Pg 162]</span>
window till she appeared to give it him.
He was more eager for it than one would
have given him credit for. He had lain
awake the night before, wondering if Nell
had really meant what she said, and what
his life would feel like when she brought
her gracious presence into it. He could
jest and be sarcastic with her when he
saw no likelihood of her consenting to
marry him, but now that she had half
consented, his feelings seemed already to
have become somewhat purified by the
very possibility of such a thing. Perhaps
those few hours of anticipation formed the
best part of Jack Portland’s existence—the
least like the years that had gone before
it. He felt humbled as he looked
back upon the past—fearful as he contemplated
the future. For the first time,
he knew himself to be utterly unworthy
of the regard or the possession of a good
woman. And as he stood beneath Nell
Llewellyn’s window, he felt certain that
she would tell him she could not consent
to such a step. Fancy, his relief and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_163">[Pg 163]</span>
pleasure when she looked for a moment
from the casement and said:</p>

<p>‘Mr Portland, I have made up my
mind, and <em>it is to be</em>.’</p>

<p class="unindent"><span class="smcap">The</span> licence having been procured, the
marriage ceremony before the registrar
of Usk was accomplished in a very few
minutes. Jack Portland had only to meet
Nell at the office the following morning,
and in half-an-hour they walked out again
man and wife. The girl was very calm
and collected over the whole affair—so
calm indeed, that her new-made husband
looked at her with surprise. They walked
back to their respective destinations by a
by-path, so that they might converse
unseen, though nobody in Usk would
have been very much astonished if they
had encountered one of the gentlemen
from the Hall taking a stroll with such
a notorious beauty as Farmer Llewellyn’s
daughter.</p>

<p>‘Well, Nell,’ commenced Jack Portland,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_165">[Pg 165]</span>
‘so it really is <i lang="fr">un fait accompli</i>, and you
are Mrs Portland. Have you told the old
people yet?’</p>

<p>‘No! I waited until, as you say, it should
be an accomplished thing.’</p>

<p>‘When shall you break the news to
them? Won’t they be very much surprised?
How will they take it, do you
think?’</p>

<p>‘Oh! they will only feel too honoured
at my having made such a good match—at
my having married a “real gentleman,”’
replied Nell, with quiet sarcasm. ‘What
else should farmers feel?’</p>

<p>‘You’ll have to tell them before you
join me at “The Three Pilchards” this
evening.’</p>

<p>‘Perhaps! It depends on what humour
they may be in. At all events, you can
announce the fact to them to-morrow
morning.’</p>

<p>‘What a funny girl you are, to want to
run away from home in so secret a manner.
Is it because of Ilfracombe’s vicinity? Are
you afraid he will be jealous? It would<span class="pagenum" id="Page_166">[Pg 166]</span>
be very unjust if he were. A regular dog-in-the-manger
sort of business.’</p>

<p>‘No! you are quite mistaken. I am afraid
of no one and nothing. I am my own
mistress, and free to do as I choose. It
is my fad to have things as I say. But
let us sit down here for a minute, whilst
we decide exactly what we intend to do.’</p>

<p>She took a seat upon a grassy bank as
she spoke, and drew a packet of letters
from her pocket. Jack Portland sat down
beside her, and regarded them ruefully.</p>

<p>‘There go all my hopes of making any
more money out of that muff Ilfracombe.
Nell, you ought to think I value you
very highly to have struck such a bargain
with you as I have.’</p>

<p>‘Do you think so?’ she rejoined. ‘Well,
I prophecy, Mr Portland, that a day will
come when you will look back and bless
me for having had the courage to buy
these letters from you, at whatever cost—a
day when you will regard the life
you have led hitherto with loathing and
abhorrence, and scorn to do a dishonourable<span class="pagenum" id="Page_167">[Pg 167]</span>
act. A day when you will thank
heaven that you are an honest man, and
live by honest work alone.’</p>

<p>‘I am afraid that day is in the clouds,
Nell, that is, if you call play dishonest,
for I should never live to see it without.’</p>

<p>‘I am not so sure of that. There
must be something better in your nature
than you have discovered yet, or you
would not have offered to make a ruined
woman like myself your wife.’</p>

<p>‘Let us hope there is, for your sake.
Now, as for our plans!’</p>

<p>‘These are foolish Lady Ilfracombe’s
letters,’ said Nell, handling the packet,
‘and here is your affirmation that there
are no more in your possession. Did
you make the appointment with her in
the meadow for this afternoon at five
o’clock?’</p>

<p>‘Yes; I wrote her a note to say I
had received the packet from London,
and would deliver it to her, without fail,
at that hour.’</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_168">[Pg 168]</span></p>

<p>‘She has good reason to doubt the
truth of your promise, but to see you in
the meadow will not be compromising, so
she will keep the appointment, and I shall
be there to meet her. You will not expect
to see me at “The Three Pilchards”
before nine.’</p>

<p>‘Can’t you come earlier?’</p>

<p>‘Not without exciting the suspicions of
my parents, and making my mother resolve
to sit up to let me in again. It will be
better as I say. At nine o’clock, or a
little after, I shall be there. I hope
the registrar will not blab the news of
our marriage through Usk before that
time.’</p>

<p>‘I think not. I pledged him to secrecy
with a golden tip. But to-morrow everyone
must know it, both at Usk Hall and
Panty-cuckoo Farm.’</p>

<p>‘Oh, yes; certainly! To-morrow everyone
must know it,’ replied Nell, in the
same impassive tone; ‘and now we had
better think of going back, Mr Portland.’</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_169">[Pg 169]</span></p>

<p>‘Not “Mr Portland” now, Nell, surely!’
said her companion. ‘You must call me
“Jack.”’</p>

<p>‘“Jack!”’ repeated the girl, as if she
were saying a lesson.</p>

<p>They rose together as she spoke, and
proceeded towards the Hall. When they
reached the farm gates, Nell slipped from
him without any further farewell, and
entered her father’s house. Jack Portland
looked after her a little wistfully.
He had married her, certainly, but had he
gained her? Had she done it only to
save Lord Ilfracombe from further disgrace
and ruin—to save his countess’s
reputation for the sake of his hitherto
unblemished name? He was not quite
sure, but he had a shrewd suspicion of
the truth, and as Mr Portland turned away,
he sighed.</p>

<p>Lady Ilfracombe was in high spirits at
luncheon that afternoon. Jack had actually
compromised himself to the degree of
<em>writing</em> to assure her she should receive
back her letters, and for the first time,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_170">[Pg 170]</span>
perhaps, she really believed him. Her
eyes were dancing, and her cheeks flushed
with expectation. When her husband
asked her how she intended to spend the
afternoon, she actually laughed across the
table at Mr Portland, as she replied, that
she had promised to take a stroll with his
friend.</p>

<p>‘Old Jack and you going botanising
together;’ exclaimed Ilfracombe; ‘that is
a good joke. Well, I was going to ask
him to ride over to Pontypool with me,
but I suppose your sex gives you the
prior claim.’</p>

<p>‘I should rather think so,’ said the
countess; ‘at least, if Mr Portland deserts
me, it will be the last time I ever make
an appointment with him, so mind that,
Mr Portland!’</p>

<p>‘Don’t alarm yourself, Lady Ilfracombe,’
replied Jack Portland, who also appeared
to be in unusually good spirits that
afternoon, ‘my word is my bond. Besides,
as you leave Usk so soon, it may be
my last opportunity of enjoying a <i lang="fr">tête-à-tête</i><span class="pagenum" id="Page_171">[Pg 171]</span>
with your ladyship for some time to come.
Is the date of your departure definitely
fixed?’</p>

<p>‘Definitely!’ replied the earl. ‘We start
<i lang="fr">en route</i> for Wiesbaden by the three o’clock
train to-morrow afternoon. We don’t expect
to be on the Continent more than a
few weeks, Jack, and when we return to
Thistlemere for the shooting, you must
join us as usual.’</p>

<p>Mr Portland looked important.</p>

<p>‘Well, I’m not quite sure of that, old
chap. It’s awfully good of you to ask
me, but we will talk of it afterwards.
If you don’t start till three to-morrow,
I expect I shall have some news to tell
you before you go.’</p>

<p>‘News!’ cried Lady Ilfracombe. ‘Oh,
Mr Portland, what is it? Do tell us at
once. What is it about? Anything to
do with us, or does it only concern yourself?
Is it good news, or bad? Now
don’t keep us in this terrible suspense.’</p>

<p>‘How like a woman,’ exclaimed Mr
Portland. ‘How much would you leave<span class="pagenum" id="Page_172">[Pg 172]</span>
for to-morrow at this rate. No, Lady
Ilfracombe, my news must really wait. It
will come on you as a great surprise,
but I hope it won’t be a disagreeable one.
Now, there is food for your curiosity to
feed on for the rest of this afternoon.
Grand news, remember, and something you
have never dreamt of before, the most
incredible thing you could conceive.’</p>

<p>‘You’re going to be married,’ cried
Nora, with feminine audacity, which set
the whole table in a roar.</p>

<p>‘Well, you <em>have</em> drawn on your imagination,
Lady Ilfracombe, this time,’ said Sir
Archibald. ‘Mr Portland, married! I
should as soon think of my kestrel hawk
going in for the domesticities.’</p>

<p>‘Jack married,’ laughed the earl. ‘Come,
you have indeed thought of the most
incredible thing you could conceive. We
shall have you writing a novel after this,
Nora. You have evidently a gift for
imagining the infinitely impossible.’</p>

<p>‘There must be something very ridiculous
about me, I fear,’ said Mr Portland,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_173">[Pg 173]</span>
‘that everyone thinks it such a far-fetched
idea that I should settle down.’</p>

<p>‘<em>You</em> settle down, old man?’ replied
Ilfracombe. ‘Yes, when you’re carried to
your grave, not before. However, let us
change so unprofitable a subject. You
are booked then, Nora, for the day, so
perhaps Lady Bowmant will permit me
to be her cavalier.’</p>

<p>‘With pleasure, Lord Ilfracombe! I
shall be delighted to get you to myself
for a little, since you are going to be
cruel enough to desert us so soon.’</p>

<p>They all rose laughing from table
after that, and dispersed to their separate
apartments.</p>

<p>It was pleasant and cool when Nora
strolled out to the meadow to meet Jack
Portland. Her thoughts were pleasant
too. On the next day she was going
to take her husband far away from the
temptation of Mr Portland’s society, and
she hoped before they met him again,
to have persuaded Ilfracombe to give up
play altogether. Those abominable letters<span class="pagenum" id="Page_174">[Pg 174]</span>
would be destroyed by that time. She
was determined that she would burn them
to ashes as soon as ever she got them
in her hands, and then the coast would
be clear before her and Ilfracombe for
the rest of their married life. She hummed
the air of a popular ditty to herself as
she walked through the rich thick grass,
expecting to see Mr Portland every moment
coming to meet her with the longed-for
packet in his hands.</p>

<p>Instead of which, a young woman plainly
attired, came up to her and said,—</p>

<p>‘I beg your pardon, Lady Ilfracombe,
but are you waiting for Mr Portland?’</p>

<p>Nora turned round exclaiming angrily,—</p>

<p>‘And what business is that of yours?’
when she recognised the speaker. ‘Oh,
Miss Llewellyn, is that you? I—I—did
not know you at first. Yes, I am waiting
for Mr Portland, though I cannot think
how you came to know it.’</p>

<p>‘Because he told me so himself, and
commissioned me to deliver this packet
to you?’</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_175">[Pg 175]</span></p>

<p>Lady Ilfracombe grew very red, as she
took the letters.</p>

<p>‘He commissioned you to give them
to me? It is very strange. I do not
understand. He said he should be here
himself. What on earth made him give
this packet to you?’</p>

<p>‘Because I insisted on it; he could
not help himself,’ replied Nell. ‘Lady
Ilfracombe, do not be angry with me for
mentioning it, but my bedroom at the
farmhouse is over that occupied by Mr
Portland, and I was at my window the
night you visited him there, and heard
all that passed between you about those
letters.’</p>

<p>‘That was eavesdropping,’ exclaimed
the countess with crimson cheeks, ‘and
you had no right to do it. If you made
use of what you overheard you would
ruin me with my husband.’</p>

<p>‘Do you think me capable of such a
thing? I should not have listened to a
single word, unless I had thought I could
do you a service by doing so. As soon<span class="pagenum" id="Page_176">[Pg 176]</span>
as I understood the dilemma you were in,
and why you had sought that man, I
resolved, if possible, to get the letters he
was so meanly withholding from you.’</p>

<p>‘<em>You</em> resolved?’ cried Nora in surprise.</p>

<p>‘Yes, and as soon as you and he had
left to return to the Hall, I went down
to his room and ransacked it in order to
find them. I had not done so when Mr
Portland came back and found me there,—after
which there was an explanation between
us, and I forced him to give them
up to me—with a written affirmation that
he has no more in his possession.’</p>

<p>‘And he assured me that he had telegraphed
to London for them, and only
received them this morning.’</p>

<p>‘If he said so, you might have been
sure it was untrue.’</p>

<p>‘Miss Llewellyn, you don’t like Jack
Portland any more than I do,’ said Nora,
looking straight in the other’s face.</p>

<p>‘I have no reason to do so, Lady
Ilfracombe.’</p>

<p>‘And you actually did this for <em>me</em>—how<span class="pagenum" id="Page_177">[Pg 177]</span>
good and sweet of you it was. I have
not been used to receive such favours from
my own sex. But why did you do it?
What am I to you?’</p>

<p>‘You are <em>his</em> wife,’ answered Nell, in
a low voice, ‘and he loves you. Lady
Ilfracombe. I believe you know who
I am.’</p>

<p>‘Yes, I think I do,’ said Nora with a
little confusion; ‘I guessed it; I recognised
you, when we first met, from your description.
You—you—are Nell Llewellyn, are
you not—who—who—’</p>

<p>‘Don’t be afraid of wounding me by
saying it,’ replied Nell, gently; ‘and don’t
shrink from me, for I shall never intrude
on your presence again.’</p>

<p>At these words, so sweetly and humbly
spoken, all the generosity of Lady Ilfracombe’s
nature was roused at once.</p>

<p>‘Shrink from you, my dear girl, and
when you have just rendered me the
greatest service possible?’ she exclaimed.
‘What a brute you must think me. Why
should I? Neither you nor I is to blame,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_178">[Pg 178]</span>
and you have been so sorely injured. We
are both Ilfracombe’s wives, I suppose,
in God’s sight, though I happen to bear
his name. It is funny, isn’t it, that a
Christian country should make such a
wide difference between a few words
pronounced by the law, and God’s great
law of Nature? But Nell, I am sorry for
you, indeed I am, and always have been.’</p>

<p>‘I believe you,’ replied Nell. ‘For I
heard you say so that night. But I did
not come here to speak with you of my
own affairs, only to give those letters
into your keeping, and to beg of you, as
you value your reputation and your husband’s
happiness, never to have any secret
dealings with Mr Portland again.’</p>

<p>‘Indeed, you may be sure of that. He
is a pitiless scoundrel, without heart or
honour. I have suffered too much at his
hands to trust him again. But how did
you manage to get these letters from him?
That is what puzzles me. How did you
bribe him, or have you got him somehow
in your power?’</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_179">[Pg 179]</span></p>

<p>‘It little matters,’ said Nell, with a
shudder of remembrance; ‘he cannot harm
me, and I shall not suffer in consequence.
But you will let me speak plainly to you,
Lady Ilfracombe?’</p>

<p>‘Say anything you like,’ replied Nora,
‘for I can never thank you enough for
what you have done for me.’</p>

<p>‘When I lived with Lord Ilfracombe, I
saw the bad influence this man had over
him—how he led him into extravagance
and vice, and took the occasion of their
so-called friendship to rob him of his
money and make him risk his good
name.’</p>

<p>‘I have seen the same, of course,’ said
the countess; ‘but Ilfracombe is so infatuated
with Portland, that he will believe
nothing against him. But now that I
have these letters, I will make my husband
break with him, if I die for it.’</p>

<p>‘Yes, do—<em>do</em>!’ cried Nell; ‘and if
need be, tell him everything, so that he
sees him in his true colours. Save Lord
Ilfracombe from further contamination, as<span class="pagenum" id="Page_180">[Pg 180]</span>
you value his happiness and his honour.’</p>

<p>‘And what am I to do for you, dear
Nell?’ asked Nora, as she took the other’s
hand. ‘How can I make you happy in
return for the great happiness you have
given me? Let me do something for
you. Don’t be proud, as you were that
day at the farm, and send me away
miserable. Give me an opportunity of
proving my gratitude.’</p>

<p>‘Do you mean that? Do you say it in
earnest?’</p>

<p>‘Indeed, indeed I do.’</p>

<p>‘Then love <em>him</em>, Lady Ilfracombe, love
him with all your heart and soul, and
never let him cast one regretful look
backwards, or blame himself for things
which were beyond his control. Tell him,
if ever he should speak to you of me,
that I acquiesced in all his decisions, and
thought them for the best—that he was
right to marry, and that I thanked God
he had secured a wife who loved him,
and whom I heard say so with her own lips.’</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_181">[Pg 181]</span></p>

<p>‘<em>You</em> loved him very dearly, Nell?’</p>

<p>Nell’s answer to this question was to sit
down suddenly on the grass, and burst
into tears, covering her poor face with
her attenuated hands, and rocking herself
two and fro in her speechless misery.
Nora sat down beside her, and threw her
arm round her waist. She remembered
nothing then but that here was—not her
husband’s former mistress—but another
woman, as loving and as entitled to happiness
as herself, who had lost by her
gain.</p>

<p>‘Nell, Nell,’ she whispered. ‘Poor,
dear Nell! Don’t cry. Ilfracombe remembers
and loves you still. It is a cruel
fate that makes our two lots so different.
Oh, poor Nell! don’t sob like that or you
will break my heart.’</p>

<p>And the countess put her arms round
the other’s neck and kissed the tears off
her cheeks. The action recalled Nell to
herself.</p>

<p>‘Thank you,’ she said softly. ‘Thank
you so much. I shall not forget that you<span class="pagenum" id="Page_182">[Pg 182]</span>
kissed me. But don’t think because I cry
that I am discontented, or wish things
altered from what they are. I know now
they are all for the best. Only love him—love
him all you are able, and have no
more secrets from him, and may God
bless you both!’</p>

<p>‘I <em>do</em> love him,’ exclaimed Lady Ilfracombe;
‘and now that you have given me
back my peace of mind, I shall be able
to show my love for him with a freer
conscience. Oh! it was terrible to feel
his kisses or hear his praises, and know
all the time that that horrid man might
carry his threats into execution at any
moment, and make my husband hate and
despise me. I wonder where Mr Portland
has gone? What will he find to say
for himself when we next meet, I wonder?’</p>

<p>‘Perhaps you may not meet him. Perhaps
he will take good care to keep out
of your way.’</p>

<p>‘What a horrid, odious man he is!’
cried Nora. ‘I would rather be dead
than married to such a man.’</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_183">[Pg 183]</span></p>

<p>‘So would I,’ said Nell; ‘but my task
is done, and I must go. Good-bye, Lady
Ilfracombe. I am glad to think I have
made you so happy.’</p>

<p>‘But I shall see you again, Nell,’ suggested
the countess. ‘We leave Usk
to-morrow afternoon; but I shall tell the
earl that I have met you, and he will
come with me to wish you good-bye.’</p>

<p>Nell’s eyes had a far-away look in
them, as she answered,—</p>

<p>‘To-morrow morning, then, Lady Ilfracombe,
bring your husband over to the
farm to say good-bye to me. And that
will be the last, last time, remember.
After that I will trouble you no more.’</p>

<p>‘You have never troubled me,’ cried
Nora genially; ‘indeed I shall look
back on this day in coming years, and
say that you are the best friend I have
ever had.’</p>

<p>Nell turned to her quite brightly, as
she replied,—</p>

<p>‘Yes, yes, I hope you will. I should
like to think that you and he thought of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_184">[Pg 184]</span>
me sometimes as your truest, though
humblest friend. For that indeed I am to
both of you.’</p>

<p>‘I feel you are; I shall tell Ilfracombe
so this very night,’ said Nora. ‘Kiss me
once more, Nell, and thank you a thousand
times. Oh, how I wish I could
repay you!’</p>

<p>‘You <em>will</em> repay me by making him
happy. But—you wear a silk handkerchief,
Lady Ilfracombe—if you would
give me that, in remembrance of this
meeting, I should prize it more than I
can say.’</p>

<p>Nora tore it impetuously off her throat.</p>

<p>‘Take it!’ she exclaimed, as she
knotted it round that of Nell. ‘How
I wish you had asked for my jewellery
case instead.’</p>

<p>Nell smiled faintly.</p>

<p>‘I never valued jewels,’ she said,
‘though there was a time when I had
plenty to wear. But this soft, little
handkerchief that has touched your neck,
it shall go with me to my grave.’</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_185">[Pg 185]</span></p>

<p>So they parted, the countess dancing
up the meadow steep again, with her
letters in her hand, as if earth held no
further care for her, and Nell walking
slowly down the incline that led to the
road, her head bent upon her breast, and
her eyes cast downwards. One going up
to the greatest joy that life holds for any
woman, the love and faith of an honest
man; the other going downwards to all
that was abhorrent and loathly. The
success of the one dependent on the
failure of the other; the happiness of the
one due to the despair of the other; the
triumph of the one built on the sacrifice
of the other. Nora, who had been so
self-willed and rebellious through life,
saved from the effects of her escapades
by Nell, who had borne her lot so
patiently, and taken all her disappointments
as righteous retribution. It appears
unequal; but it is the way things are
worked in this world. The race is not
always to the swift nor the battle to the
strong. In the next world there will be<span class="pagenum" id="Page_186">[Pg 186]</span>
dust and ashes for some of the great and
fortunate ones of this earth, and crowns
for the lowly and the despised. And
Nell Llewellyn’s crown will sparkle with
jewels as heaven is studded with its
stars.</p>

<p class="unindent"><span class="smcap">As</span> the Countess of Ilfracombe returned
to the Hall, with her packet of letters in
her hand, her heart was very glad, but
at the same time it was filled with soberer
thoughts than it had indulged in for some
time past. What was after all the
great difference between her and Nell
Llewellyn? She had not fallen, it was
true—she had not openly disgraced herself—but
what had her flirtation with
Jack Portland been if not a lowering of
her womanly dignity; a soiling of her
purity; a smirching of the delicate bloom
and whiteness that should have protected
her maidenly life as with a veil? Nora
felt terribly ashamed of herself as she
remembered it. Her great fear had
passed away, thanks to Nell’s interest
and intrepidity, and her mind had time to<span class="pagenum" id="Page_188">[Pg 188]</span>
think of other things. This poor despised
girl had saved her from all sorts of
horrors; preserved her husband’s faith in
her; his love for her; had placed in her
hand, as it were, the whole happiness
of her life. But she herself—if she destroyed
these letters, as she fully intended
to do, how would she be any better than
before—any more deserving of Ilfracombe’s
affection and confidence? She would be
safe, it is true, but safety did not constitute
worthiness. And Nora had begun
to long to <em>deserve</em> her husband’s love—to
be able to accept it with an unburdened
conscience—feeling that there
was nothing between them, not even a
shadow cast from the past. Could she,
she asked herself, as she wended homewards,
ever summon up the courage to
tell him everything, to make him the
arbiter of her destiny, to constitute him
her judge and await the sentence he chose
to pronounce upon her? It would be very
awful she thought, terrible beyond description;
she did not think she could<span class="pagenum" id="Page_189">[Pg 189]</span>
possibly undergo such an ordeal. She
pictured to herself Ilfracombe’s stern
face as he listened to the unfolding of a
tale so dissonant to his own feelings, so
unlike all he had conceived of her, so
dreadful to hear of the woman of whom
he thought so highly, who he had chosen
for his wife before all others. Nora
shuddered when she thought thus, and
told herself that it could not be. She
valued his good opinion and his affection
too highly. But there was another side
of the question. Without telling Lord
Ilfracombe, her own part in the matter,
how could she convince him of the
treachery of Jack Portland towards them
both; how induce him to break off, once
and for ever, the dangerous intimacy
which united them. Her husband might
refuse to believe her mere word, as he
had refused before. He was a loyal
friend, and a generous man. He would
not judge anyone on the unproved testimony
of another person. Without the
proof which those letters conveyed, would<span class="pagenum" id="Page_190">[Pg 190]</span>
she have any more influence with him
than she had had before, when he pooh-poohed
her warnings as the idle fears of
a well-meaning but ignorant woman?
And had she the courage for the sake
of them both, and especially for the sake
of the husband whom she was beginning
to love far better than she did herself,
to brave the verdict of Ilfracombe’s displeasure,
and tell him the whole truth?
Nell had been courageous for both their
sakes. From a worldly point of view
she had no particular reason to care for
the earl’s interests, still less for those
of the wife who had supplanted her; yet
she had braved being called a thief, and
any other hard name Mr Portland might
have thought fit in his rage to cast at
her, in order to do good to those who
had in a measure wronged her. Nell was
worth a thousand of Nora, so the wife
of Ilfracombe said inwardly as she dwelt
on these things. And musing after this
fashion she reached the Hall, not much
happier than she had left it. It was true<span class="pagenum" id="Page_191">[Pg 191]</span>
that she had regained possession of the
letters which had made a nightmare of
her married life, but they had not brought
the peace with them which she had
imagined they would. She was out of
a certain danger, but she was still <em>herself</em>,
that was what Nora thought, still, a wife
who had deceived her trusting husband,
and would not be cleansed in her own
eyes till she had made a full confession
of her sin. It was contemplating the
divine forgiveness which Nell had extended
to them both, the single-heartedness
which she displayed, the patience
and humility with which she bore her
own sad lot, which was influencing Lady
Ilfracombe almost unconsciously to imitate
her as far as lay in her power.</p>

<p>Her indecision, combined with the
promptings of the good angel within her,
to do what was right, made Nora <i lang="fr">distraite</i>
and melancholy during the period of
dressing for dinner, and when Lord
Ilfracombe joined her he chaffed her on
the bad effects of botanising with Jack.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_192">[Pg 192]</span></p>

<p>‘You had much better have come out
with Lady Bowmant and myself, Nora,’
he said; ‘we have had a rousing time,
but you look as dull as ditch water.
What has old Jack been saying to you
to quench your spirits?’</p>

<p>‘Your dear particular friend has not
been saying anything at all to me,
Ilfracombe. I have not set eyes on him.
He did not keep his appointment.’</p>

<p>The earl suspended his operations of
dressing, and turned round to regard
her with surprise.</p>

<p>‘Jack didn’t turn up?’ he ejaculated.
‘Why, what on earth can be the
reason?’</p>

<p>‘I don’t know,’ replied Nora; ‘and
what’s more, I don’t care.’</p>

<p>‘Ah, my lady, that sounds very much
like pique,’ exclaimed her husband, laughing;
‘but for Jack not to keep an
appointment with you, I cannot understand
such a thing. I hope nothing’s the
matter with him.’</p>

<p>‘What should be the matter, Mr<span class="pagenum" id="Page_193">[Pg 193]</span>
Portland’s like a bad halfpenny. He’s
bound to come back again.’</p>

<p>‘And how did you spend your afternoon
then, darling?’ asked the earl;
‘wasn’t it very stupid? How I wish you
had come with us instead.’</p>

<p>‘<em>I</em> don’t, Ilfracombe, for I have passed
a very eventful afternoon. There is no
time to tell you of it now, but you shall
hear all <a id="chg1"></a>of it when we find ourselves alone
again. There’s the second gong; we
must go down. Now we shall hear what
Mr Portland has to say for himself.’</p>

<p>They heard it as soon as they entered
the drawing-room, where their hosts were
waiting for them.</p>

<p>‘Our party will be smaller than usual
to-night, I am sorry to tell you,’ said
Lady Bowmant. ‘I have just had a
note from Mr Portland to say he has
been called away on important business
till to-morrow. Isn’t it extraordinary? He
doesn’t say where, or by whom? When
did he get the summons? That is what
puzzles me. He said nothing about it<span class="pagenum" id="Page_194">[Pg 194]</span>
at luncheon. In fact, he settled to take
a walk with you, if I am not mistaken,
Lady Ilfracombe.’</p>

<p>‘Yes, but he did not come,’ answered Nora.</p>

<p>‘I never knew old Jack to do such a
thing in his life before,’ remarked the earl,
‘he is generally so punctual in his engagements.
And as for business, why, he has
no business, except pleasure. The idlest,
most unpractical man I ever knew. What
<em>can</em> the matter be? I am quite curious
to learn.’</p>

<p>‘Well, we must manage to do without
him to-night, at all events,’ said Lady
Bowmant, who appeared to be rather
offended by the breach of politeness. ‘I
think Mr Portland might have given us
a little more notice, but it is really of no
consequence.’</p>

<p>‘And he might have let my wife know
he couldn’t walk with her, instead of leaving
her to cool her heels in the field
waiting for him half the afternoon. I
shall have a crow to pluck with Master
Jack for this to-morrow.’</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_195">[Pg 195]</span></p>

<p>‘Oh, Ilfracombe! do you really think
it is worth while?’ exclaimed Nora. ‘I
hope none of you will let him imagine
that his absence was of the slightest consequence.’</p>

<p>‘It becomes of consequence when he
treats you with so little ceremony,’ replied
the earl, as he offered his arm to his
hostess to conduct her to the dining-room.</p>

<p>Mr Portland’s vagaries were not mentioned
again during the evening; but
when Lord Ilfracombe entered his wife’s
room that night and found her resting
on the sofa in her dressing-gown, instead
of fast asleep in bed, the subject was renewed
between them.</p>

<p>‘Why, my darling, how is this?’ he
exclaimed, ‘is your book so interesting
that you cannot tear yourself away from
it, or are you not sleepy to-night?’</p>

<p>‘Neither,’ answered Nora, gravely. ‘I
was only waiting for my husband.’</p>

<p>‘And now you have your husband,’
he answered playfully, as he cast himself
down beside her, ‘what is it?’</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_196">[Pg 196]</span></p>

<p>‘I want to have a little talk with you
Ilfracombe,’ she said, ‘and I don’t know
how to begin.’</p>

<p>‘What is it all about, sweetheart?’ he
asked her with a kiss. His manner was
enough to disarm any amount of fears,
but it was so confident that it made Nora
still more nervous.</p>

<p>‘I wish you wouldn’t kiss me,’ she
said, almost petulantly. ‘I am going to tell
you something about myself, that will make
you very angry, and then you will think I accepted
your kisses on false pretences.’</p>

<p>‘I am sorry to hear you say that
Nora,’ he replied; ‘but whatever you may
have done, I can assure you of my forgiveness
beforehand, so you can take my
kiss as an instalment in advance.’</p>

<p>‘Don’t you be too sure of that,’ said
his wife. ‘It is something that happened
before our marriage, and I wasn’t too
good a girl then, I can assure you. I did
all sort of awful things, and I feel sure
you will wish you had never married
me when you hear them.’</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_197">[Pg 197]</span></p>

<p>‘And why do you tell me of them
now, my dear girl? We have been
married a year, and you have never
thought of doing such a thing before.
Neither do I desire to hear anything
about the past. Let it rest in peace.
You know I was not a saint myself.’</p>

<p>‘But you told me all about that Ilfracombe,
and I was so silly, I was too
frightened to follow your example.’</p>

<p>‘But who dared to frighten you
darling? Couldn’t you trust your husband?’
he said tenderly. Nora snuggled
up close to his side and buried her face
in his bosom as she whispered,—</p>

<p>‘No, because I loved you so, I was
afraid of losing your love and esteem, if
you knew what a wild reckless girl I have
been. Ilfracombe, do you remember one
day after we were engaged, when you
asked me if I had ever had a lover before
yourself, what I replied?’</p>

<p>‘That you had, had so many you
couldn’t count them, I believe,’ said the
earl, laughing.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_198">[Pg 198]</span></p>

<p>‘No, no, not that, but that there had
been one man to whom I was engaged,
but papa would not hear of our marriage
because he had no money.’</p>

<p>‘Yes! Well, what of him?’</p>

<p>‘It was Mr Portland,’ said Nora, with
her face still hidden. But her husband,
in his astonishment, sat bolt upright and
put her away.</p>

<p>‘Jack, oh! impossible! Nora, why did
you not tell me of this before?’</p>

<p>‘Because, oh, I am coming to that
by-and-bye. But, indeed, it is true. He
was at Malta, you may remember, just
at that time, two years before I met you,
and staying with his sister Mrs Loveless.
He told you he had met me there. He
was very different in appearance then from
what he is now, and I flirted and “spooned,”
with him till I fancied I was head over
ears in love, and he incited me on to be
far more wild than I had ever been
before. When I look back and think
how young and foolish I was, I see he
behaved very badly to me.’</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_199">[Pg 199]</span></p>

<p>‘Tell me all, Nora,’ said the earl sternly.</p>

<p>‘I <em>will</em> tell you all; don’t be afraid,
I used to creep out of my father’s house
after dinner, and meet Mr Portland late
at night, sometimes as late as twelve
o’clock, and then sneak back again when
everyone had gone to bed. We used to
sit under the orange trees for hours,
talking, and all that sort of folly, you
know—’</p>

<p>‘Oh, yes, I know,’ acquiesced the
earl with a groan.</p>

<p>‘And one day we went out in a boat
and were caught in a squall and had to
stay away till the morning. We were with
people all the time in a little inn, and
papa never found out that Mr Portland
was with me, but he was!’</p>

<p>‘Any more pleasant stories to tell me?’
asked her husband.</p>

<p>‘No, that is the worst (bad enough too,
isn’t it?), as far as I am concerned, but
I was foolish enough during that time
to write Jack a lot of letters. I used to
write two and three times a day when<span class="pagenum" id="Page_200">[Pg 200]</span>
I didn’t see him, and in them I spoke
very freely of all the pranks we had played
together. He wrote to me as well, of
course, but when we parted I destroyed
his letters, but he kept mine.’</p>

<p>‘Hasn’t he given them up to you?’
demanded Ilfracombe quickly.</p>

<p>‘I have them now; but listen quietly
to me, Ilfracombe, for a moment. You
were rather vexed with me when we first
came home to Thistlemere, because I did
not welcome your bosom friend with the
cordiality you wished me to extend to
him. Why, if I had had the courage
to tell you the truth, you would have
kicked him out of the house. For, from
the moment we met again, whenever Mr
Portland has seen my disapproval of his
influence over you in racing and gambling
matters, he has held the threat over my
head, that if I tried to dissuade you from
throwing your money away, he would
hand over those letters of mine, and
make you hate and despise me as much
as he did.’</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_201">[Pg 201]</span></p>

<p>‘The scoundrel!’ said Ilfracombe
between his teeth.</p>

<p>‘He has promised over and over again
to restore me those letters,’ continued
Nora, ‘and again and again he has
broken his word. He never meant to
give them to me at all, I am convinced
of that. He knew that, as soon as I got
them into my own hands, I should have
the courage to speak to you, and prove
to you how unworthy he is.’</p>

<p>‘How did you get them at last, then,
Nora?’</p>

<p>‘Now comes the hardest part of my
confession, Ilfracombe, and I shall never
be able to make it whilst you look at me
like that.’</p>

<p>The earl tried to smile as he replied,—</p>

<p>‘I am not angry with you, Nora, only
utterly disgusted with Jack for turning
out such a low blackguard, and with myself
for being so blind as to believe him
to be an honourable man.’</p>

<p>‘But you will be angry with me for<span class="pagenum" id="Page_202">[Pg 202]</span>
this. Two nights ago he told me that if
I went over to his room at the farm I
should receive my letters—and I <em>went</em>.’</p>

<p>‘You visited Portland at his sleeping
apartments? Oh, Nora, I thought you
had too much pride in your position as
my wife—too much respect for yourself—to
do such a thing!’</p>

<p>‘I would not have gone for anything
but those letters,’ she cried. ‘Oh, Ilfracombe,
believe me and forgive me! I
never was a liar. He said they were in
his despatch-box, and I was fool enough
to believe him, and fell into the trap.
And when I got there, he declared he
had made a mistake, and must have left
them in town—all lies, all lies!’</p>

<p>‘Then how did you get them at
last?’</p>

<p>‘He wrote me a note this morning—here
it is,’ said Nora, as she produced it
from her blotting-case—‘to say he had
telegraphed for the packet, and it had
arrived from town, and if I would meet
him in the meadow this afternoon I should<span class="pagenum" id="Page_203">[Pg 203]</span>
receive them. That was the secret of
my taking a walk with him, you see,
Ilfracombe. <em>I</em> take a walk voluntarily
with the brute! I would rather be hanged,
any day!’ cried Nora impetuously.</p>

<p>‘But he never came, you say.’</p>

<p>‘No; but someone else did. Can you
guess who it was? That Miss Llewellyn
from the farm. She is really your girl;
she is no more drowned than I am, and,
oh, she is so sweet and nice! However
did you come to give her up for
me?’</p>

<p>‘Don’t talk nonsense, Nora!’ said the
earl. ‘I knew some days back that
Nell is still alive, but thought it just as
well not to mention the subject to
you. But did she bring you your
letters?’</p>

<p>‘Yes, she did, the dear, good girl.
She was at her bedroom window, which
overlooks Portland’s, when I went there,
and heard my entreaties to him to return
my letters, and his brutal, sarcastic replies;
so as soon as I was gone she<span class="pagenum" id="Page_204">[Pg 204]</span>
confronted him, and <em>made</em> him give them
up to her—how, she did not tell me,
only he did—and she brought them to
me. Oh, I <em>was</em> glad! I kissed her a
dozen times for her kindness.’</p>

<p>‘But <em>why</em> did she do it?’ demanded
the earl. ‘I cannot understand her interest
in the matter, nor how she induced Portland
to do what you could not. It was
like Nell; she always was resolute and
plucky; but what was the motive?’</p>

<p>‘Her love for you, Ilfracombe,’ replied
his wife gravely, ‘and her desire to
keep your name untarnished. Oh! you
have never known what was in her noble
nature, that is very clear. She is twice
the woman I am, or ever shall be. She
ought to have been your wife, and she is
fit for it.’</p>

<p>‘Nora, Nell is a good girl, and I
deeply regret the part I played in soiling
her life; but there is only one wife in
the world for me, and she is by my side.
It was very good of poor Nell, very
generous, very kind, to have done what<span class="pagenum" id="Page_205">[Pg 205]</span>
she has done for you, and we must think
of some means of repaying her. And I
am glad to tell you, for her sake and my
own, that she is going to be married herself.
She came to see me this morning
about some business of her father’s, and
told me the news.’</p>

<p>‘Going to be married!’ repeated Nora,
with womanly intuition. ‘Are you <em>sure</em>?’
She did not mention such a thing to me;
and she looked so sad and spoke so sadly,
she made me cry. I don’t think she can
be going to be married. And when I
asked her what I could do to return her
kindness, she said,—“Love him with all
your heart and soul, and never have a
secret from him again.”’</p>

<p>‘And do you, Nora?’ whispered Ilfracombe.</p>

<p>‘What?’</p>

<p>‘Love me with all your heart and
soul.’</p>

<p>She turned, and threw her arms about
his neck.</p>

<p>‘I do—I do! my darling, and never<span class="pagenum" id="Page_206">[Pg 206]</span>
so much as at this moment. Neither will
I ever have a secret from you again.
There are the letters,’ she continued, as
she drew the packet from her pocket
and placed it in his hand. ‘They were
written so long ago that I don’t remember
what is in them; but whatever it may
be—good, bad or indifferent—read it all,
dear, and judge me as you will. At
all events, you will know the worst,
and I need not fear that I am claiming
your love under false pretences for the
future.’</p>

<p>‘And so this is the poor little packet that
has kept us apart for so long,’ murmured
the earl, as he regarded it, ‘but, thank
God, has not been powerful enough to
sever us from each other’s confidence for
ever. And you give me leave to do
what I will with it—to read its contents
from end to end?’</p>

<p>‘Yes, yes. Only be quick about it;
the suspense of your decision is so hard
to bear. Perhaps, who knows, Ilfracombe,
after you have seen the folly I have<span class="pagenum" id="Page_207">[Pg 207]</span>
written to another man, you may not
wish to have anything to do with me
again.’</p>

<p>‘Yes, I should think that was very
probable,’ remarked the earl, with quiet
amusement, as he placed the packet in
the empty grate and lighted a match
under it. ‘See! Nora, that is how I
read your poor little love-letters of long
ago. How amusing they are! But, confound
the things! they won’t burn. Come,
that’s better. They’re blazing up beautifully
now; and I only wish I could
see Mr Jack Portland blazing up with
them!’</p>

<p>Lady Ilfracombe looked up joyfully.</p>

<p>‘Oh, darling, is that true?’ she exclaimed.
‘Shall we never have our happiness
interrupted more by looking on him
again?’</p>

<p>‘Why, rather not! What do you take
me for? Do you think I would associate
with the man who has played you such a
dirty trick, and nearly upset our married
happiness? No, my dearest; I value you<span class="pagenum" id="Page_208">[Pg 208]</span>
too much for that. Mr Portland has seen
the last of any house which owns me as
master.’</p>

<p>‘Oh, Ilfracombe, you have made me so
exquisitely happy! Oh, how I wish poor
Nell were as happy as I am. I told her
we were leaving Usk to-morrow, and
promised that we would go over to the
farm together first, and wish her farewell.
You will come with me, won’t you,
darling?’</p>

<p>‘Of course I will, since you wish it.
You have behaved in a most generous
manner regarding this young woman, Nora,
and I shall never forget it. That reminds
me that, according to my promise to her
this morning, I have been sounding Sir
Archibald as to the chance of being able
to purchase Panty-cuckoo Farm, and I find
he is quite ready to sell it at a reasonable
price. I fancy they are getting rather hard-up
on account of her ladyship’s extravagance.
So I intend to close with him,
and make over the title-deeds to Nell as a
wedding present. She refused to let me<span class="pagenum" id="Page_209">[Pg 209]</span>
make any provision for her, as I think I
told you, but this I shall insist upon.’</p>

<p>‘Yes, do; it was just like her, dear thing,
to refuse your money. Ilfracombe, you owe
her a great deal. She was very much attached
to you. I could see that by every
word she said.’</p>

<p>‘Hush, Nora dear, don’t allude to it
now. You women are apt to grow sentimental
when you get together, talking over
the same man. She cared for me well
enough—so did I for her; but you see we
are both going to be married, and live
happy ever afterwards. That is the end
of most fairy tales, whether they happen
in this world or the other. Kiss me, my
own darling, and tell me once more that
you love me. That is the only thing that
concerns us now.’</p>

</div>


<p class="unindent"><span class="smcap">Mr Portland</span> had two reasons for not
appearing at Usk Hall on the evening of
the day he married Nell Llewellyn. In
the first place, he did not fancy seeing the
countess again after she had heard the
truth about her letters; in the second, he
foresaw more difficulty in getting away, if
he left it till after dinner. To have received
a summons to London by telegraph
or post in the afternoon, and to have been
compelled to quit Usk at once, seemed
more feasible to him than to announce
his determination before the assembled
company, to be submitted to their cross
questioning—sent to the railway station in
Sir Archibald’s carriage, perhaps accompanied
by the genial host himself, and to
have to bribe the servants to conceal the
fact that he never went at all. After that<span class="pagenum" id="Page_211">[Pg 211]</span>
evening, so he argued, when all the world
must know that he had married Nell, he
would not mind confessing the little ruse
to which he had had recourse, and felt sure
of receiving sympathy and forgiveness. So
he went to ‘The Three Pilchards’ and
engaged his rooms, and ordered his dinner
in a state of pleased expectancy. The
accommodation was not very grand—the
<i lang="fr">cuisine</i> would, doubtless, not be first-rate,
but Nell had never been a <i lang="fr">gourmande</i> nor
a sybarite, and Mr Portland pleased himself
with thinking how well he would treat
her in the future. What with the various
race-meetings he had attended, he had
been pretty lucky lately, and the visit to
Usk Hall had not failed to recoup him
still more. He would be able to take his
wife abroad to Paris or Italy, if she so
wished it, and show her a little life. Perhaps,
though, it would be better to run
over to Monte Carlo or Hamburg, and
so combine business with pleasure. How
divinely handsome she was, ‘a daughter of
the gods, divinely tall, and most divinely<span class="pagenum" id="Page_212">[Pg 212]</span>
fair!’ With what envious eyes he would
be followed by the frequenters of the places
he thought of. He had little fear that his
wife would be recognised by the herd as
Lord Ilfracombe’s former mistress. She
had kept herself too much at home for
that, and had hardly ever been seen in
public whilst living with the earl. It would
only be a few of his intimates who would
be likely to know her again. And Jack
Portland would not have concerned himself
about it if they had. He had married his
wife for himself—not for the world, and it
was welcome to think what it liked of his
choice. A few old cats, whose virtue had
never been attacked during the best part of
a century, might turn up their noses at
her; but Nell was strong enough to hold
her own, and so was he. If a thought
crossed his mind that Ilfracombe, on hearing
of his marriage with Nell, might insist
on giving her as a wedding portion what
she had refused as a peace-offering, we
must do him the justice to say that it had
no weight with him, excepting as it might<span class="pagenum" id="Page_213">[Pg 213]</span>
prove the earl’s good feeling towards them
both, and be the precursor of a renewed
intimacy. For, if something of the kind
did not interfere, Jack Portland felt that
the condition Nell had made regarding the
packet of letters would prove the quietus
to his friendship with Ilfracombe. If the
countess told her husband the whole truth,
he would never receive him again. Of that
he was certain. But there was the chance
that, for her own sake, Nora would <em>not</em>
tell him the truth, and in that case, if he
heard of the marriage first, he might never
be told of the other little affair at all, and
the countess secure of herself, might join
her husband in extending her hospitality
to him. This was what Mr Portland was
dreaming of as he sat in the parlour of
‘The Three Pilchards’ smoking, and waiting
for Nell’s arrival. As the time went
on, and she did not appear, he grew rather
fidgety. He had had his dinner at
his usual hour of seven, but, as nine
o’clock sounded, it struck him that
Nell might expect to see supper<span class="pagenum" id="Page_214">[Pg 214]</span>
waiting for her, so rang the bell to order
it.</p>

<p>‘What have you in the house? What
can I have for supper?’</p>

<p>‘Supper, sir?’ echoed the country waiter,
who though he could play a very pretty
tune with a knife and fork himself, was
rather taken aback at the gentleman
requiring supper at nine, after a hearty
dinner at seven.</p>

<p>‘Yes. Are you deaf? I expect my
wife here soon, and she may require something
to eat. What can we have?’</p>

<p>‘We have a joint of cold beef in the
house, sir, and a veal and ham pie, and—’</p>

<p>‘None of those will do. I want something
hot.’</p>

<p>‘A chicken, sir, with a cauliflower and
potatoes?’ suggested the waiter.</p>

<p>‘Yes, yes. The best you have, whatever
it may be. Get it ready as soon as you
can. My wife may be here at any moment.
Another bottle of that champagne
too, which I had at dinner. Cursed bad
stuff,’ he added to himself, as the servant<span class="pagenum" id="Page_215">[Pg 215]</span>
left the room, ‘but women don’t know the
difference. Well, who would ever have
thought I could have stood such discomfort
as this, with so good a grace, for the sake
of a woman? But <em>such</em> a woman! I don’t
believe she has her peer in England. As
for that little sharp-featured, flirting, deceitful
countess, she can’t hold a candle to
her. What fools and blind men are with
regard to women! It is quite impossible
to decide why one piece of femininity
should hold them as in a vice whilst they
pass over or ignore the virtues of another.
Now, to my mind, Nell combines all the
perfections of which human nature is capable.
She is beautiful, amiable (a bit of a
temper, but she very seldom shows it, and
a woman is worth nothing without a spice
of the devil in her), dignified, sensible,
and modest. She would have made a
magnificent countess; beaten Lady D——
and Lady S——, and all the other Court
beauties hollow. However, I’m very glad
Ilfracombe didn’t see it in that light, and
that the crumbs from the rich man’s table<span class="pagenum" id="Page_216">[Pg 216]</span>
have fallen to my share. Hang it all!
What a time she is. It’s nearly ten.
Surely she isn’t going to play-off any airs
and graces on me, and pose as a blushing
bride. Or is it only a womanly dodge to
make her welcome more assured? She
needn’t fear missing it. I never felt so
much for any woman in my life before. I
almost think, if she thought it worth her
while, that she might make a better man
of me. I wonder if she will learn to love
me? I know what her love for that ass
Ilfracombe was, and that it is worth a
man’s trying for. I wonder—I wonder—by
Jove! that’s the half-hour striking.
Whatever can be the reason of this delay?
Waiter,’ continued Mr Portland to the man,
who now appeared with the supper, ‘is
that half-past ten that struck just now?
Surely, your clocks must be very
fast.’</p>

<p>‘Don’t think so, sir! I heard the
missus asking the master to put ’em
on a bit just now. Do you think the
lady will come to-night, sir?’</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_217">[Pg 217]</span></p>

<p>‘Of course she will! What do you
mean by asking me such a question?’</p>

<p>‘Only, you see, sir, we’re obliged to
close at eleven, whether we like or no,
so the missus told me to ask you
if—’</p>

<p>‘Here!’ exclaimed Jack Portland,
quickly; ‘get me pen and ink and paper
at once. I must send a messenger up to
Panty-cuckoo Farm!’</p>

<p>‘Panty-cuckoo Farm,’ repeated the
waiter; ‘Mr Llewellyn’s place? That be
better than a mile and an’ arf away from
here, sir. It’ll take a good bit of time
to carry a letter there to-night.’</p>

<p>‘Never mind! I’m willing to pay for
it, and for keeping you up as well, but
the message must be carried by some
one. Whom have you to send?’</p>

<p>‘I expect the ostler can go, but I’ll
ask the missus,’ replied the waiter, as
he went to consult the higher powers.</p>

<p>In a few minutes he returned to say
the ostler would take the letter, and Mr
Portland despatched <a id="chg2"></a>the missive on its<span class="pagenum" id="Page_218">[Pg 218]</span>
way. It contained but a very few words,
only, ‘What is the reason of this delay?
Pray come at once! Am waiting here impatiently.
<span class="smcap">Jack.</span>’</p>

<p>He did not know into whose hands
it might fall, so thought it best to be as
curt as possible, and then he sat down to
get through the time as best he might
till his messenger returned. How trying
are the moments when we wait in utter
darkness, the explanation of some mystery
which is inexplicable to us. What a
thousand and one fancies rush through
our brain, as we attempt to penetrate
what is impenetrable! How we ‘think’
it may be that—or we ‘fancy’ it must be
this—or we ‘fear’ the other. Then, tired
out with conjecture, we resolve not to
think at all, but wait the natural sequence
of events, only to fall back upon fancy
and worry ourselves to death with imagination,
and, after all, it usually turns out
to be nothing—a bogy conjectured up by
our anxiety—due as likely as not to the
selfishness of our friend, who had not<span class="pagenum" id="Page_219">[Pg 219]</span>
sufficient feeling for us to suspect what
we were suffering on his behalf. We
have all, at some time or other, experienced
the feeling of suspense under which
Mr Portland was suffering now,—yes, actually
<em>suffering</em>!</p>

<p>This selfish, immoral, dishonourable man
had found his match at last in fate. Nell
Llewellyn was the one creature who had
ever awakened any better or higher feelings
in his hardened heart, and he was
suffering the agony of thinking that she
might have repented of her bargain and
meant to play him false as he had played
so many other people. The ostler took
his time to walk to Panty-cuckoo Farm.
He was going to be paid for his trouble
under any circumstances, so he didn’t see
the fun of hurrying himself. Besides, the
farm was more than a mile away, and one
mile makes two on a dark night, so
it was twelve o’clock before the waiter
reappeared with Mr Portland’s own note
on a salver.</p>

<p>‘If you please, sir, the hostler, he ‘ave<span class="pagenum" id="Page_220">[Pg 220]</span>
been to Panty-cuckoo Farm, but everybody’s
a-bed, and he couldn’t make no one
hear.’</p>

<p>‘Couldn’t make anybody hear!’ exclaimed
Jack Portland, starting to his feet;
‘what was the fool about? Why didn’t
he knock till he <em>did</em> make some one hear?
What was the good of his going, when
he only brings me my own note back
again?’</p>

<p>‘Well, sir; he did throw stones at the
bedroom winders, but no one took no
notice of ’im, so Joe, he thought, ’twas no
use waiting about there any longer at
this time o’ night, so he bringed the note
back again, and, perhaps, you’d like me to
send it up the first thing in the morning.’</p>

<p>‘No, no,’ replied Jack Portland, angrily;
‘the ostler is a d——d fool for his pains,
and you may tell him I said so. Leave
the note on the table and leave the room.
I wish to be alone!’</p>

<p>‘Are we to shut up, sir? Will the lady
come to-night, do you think? The last
train was in an hour ago!’</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_221">[Pg 221]</span></p>

<p>‘Shut up! shut up! Yes! Do anything
you like. I don’t care so long as
you leave me alone,’ was the reply.</p>

<p>‘Yes, sir; certainly, and what time
would you like to be called in the morning,
sir?’</p>

<p>‘Oh! go to the devil!’ cried Portland
furiously, as the man disappeared, repeating
his usual formula of ‘Yes, sir;’ ‘thank
you, sir,’ and left him to his disappointment
and conjectures.</p>

<p>What <em>could</em> be the matter? Where was
Nell? What was she doing? What did
she mean? These were the questions
that repeated themselves over and over
in his brain, and which received no answer
till the following morning. He would
have his answer then, he thought. He
would go up to Panty-cuckoo Farm the
very first thing and tell the Llewellyns of
his marriage to their daughter, and, if need
be, take his wife back with him by force.
No power on earth could prevent that.
But it was not the sort of honeymoon he
had promised himself.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_222">[Pg 222]</span></p>

<p>Meanwhile Lord and Lady Ilfracombe
were saying to each other, as we have
seen before, ‘We will go over to the
farm to-morrow morning and say good-bye
to Nell, and tell her of all the good
things we mean to do for her when she
is married,’ and so at last they all slept,
the husband and wife locked in each
other’s arms—Jack Portland, restlessly, and
starting up now and then to remember his
disappointment with an oath, and Nell
Llewellyn slept also, the sweetest and
most peaceful sleep of them all.</p>

<p>She had gone straight home to her
parents when she parted with Nora, and
had passed a very pleasant evening with
them. The old people had been particularly
cheerful. Bonnie, the cow, had quite
recovered, and was giving her milk as well
as ever; and Sir Archibald Bowmant had
met the farmer on his way home and intimated
to him that he was likely to have a
change of landlords.</p>

<p>‘I do think,’ said Mr Llewellyn, ‘as his
lordship buying the old farm is the grandest<span class="pagenum" id="Page_223">[Pg 223]</span>
thing I’ve ever heard on, and, if it come
to pass (and Sir Archibald spoke of it as
a settled thing), mother and me shall
feel as we owe it all to you, my lass.
Sha’n’t us, mother?’</p>

<p>‘Yes, indeed,’ acquiesced the old woman,
‘it’s all due to Nell, there’s no question
of that. It was a fortunate day for us
when you took service with the earl, Nell,
though we were both set agen you going
to London at the time; but there, one
never knows how things will turn out.’</p>

<p>Nell looked gratified by her parents’
approval. She had been more serious and
silent than usual that evening, but now
she seemed to brighten up, and talked
with them of all they should do and say
when Lord Ilfracombe came to tell them
of his kindness in person.</p>

<p>‘Ay! but that will be a grand occasion,’
quoth her mother; ‘and you must
do credit to it, my lass. I daresay the
earl will bring his lady with him, and
we must all put on our Sunday best to
do them honour.’</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_224">[Pg 224]</span></p>

<p>‘Mother,’ said Nell presently, ‘I have
something to tell you. I saw Lady Ilfracombe
in the fields this afternoon, and
she said that she and the earl intended
to call here to-morrow morning. They
are going to leave Usk Hall to-morrow
afternoon, and so I daresay they will take
this opportunity to tell father about the
farm. You mustn’t go out to-morrow,
father, till you have seen him.’</p>

<p>‘<em>I</em> go out,’ exclaimed the farmer, ‘on
such an occasion? I should think not.
Why no one in the house shall stir till
they’re come and gone. Has the parlour
been swept to-day, for if not you and
mother will have to stay up till it’s done?
I couldn’t have his lordship sitting down
in a dusty room. That wouldn’t be the
way to make him think us good tenants.’</p>

<p>‘A dusty room,’ cried the old woman
indignantly. ‘We’ve been man and wife
now for five-and-twenty years come Michaelmas,
Griffith Llewellyn, and you can’t name
the day you’ve ever seen my parlour
dusty yet. The Queen herself, God bless<span class="pagenum" id="Page_225">[Pg 225]</span>
her, might enter it any day in the week
and not soil her royal robes.’</p>

<p>‘Well, well, wife, there’s enough words
about that,’ said her husband. ‘I’m proud
to hear his lordship’s coming to Panty-cuckoo,
and glad that Nell gave us warning
of it. Did you find an opportunity
to ask if there’s a chance of your entering
the earl’s service again, my girl?’ he
continued to his daughter.</p>

<p>Nell left her seat and approached her
father’s side, winding her arm round the
old man’s neck, and laying her cheek
gently against his. ‘No, dear father,’ she
said, ‘I didn’t mention the subject. I
don’t think I shall ever go to service
again, dear. I am not so strong as I was,
and it would be too hard for me.’</p>

<p>She strangled a kind of sob in her
throat as she proceeded:—</p>

<p>‘I have been a great burden on you
for the last year, father; but I won’t be
so much longer. If I can’t go to service,
I will provide for myself some way, don’t
fear that.’</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_226">[Pg 226]</span></p>

<p>‘Ay, my lass, it will be as well.
You’re a bonny lass, there’s no denying,
but you don’t seem to care much for
marriage, and when your mother and me
is gone you’ll have a sore shift to provide
for yourself if you have no work to
do. I mentioned his lordship’s service
because it seems to me as if it has left
you pretty well unfit for anything else.
Your hands and face and your constitootion
ain’t fit for a farm-house, Nell, and
that’s the truth. They improved you and
they spiled you both up in London.
You’re fitter for the town than the country,
any one could see that with half an eye.
But you’re a good girl, my dear, and mother
and me, we both say that.’</p>

<p>‘Thank you, father,’ she replied, as she
kissed him several times, more times than
were necessary, according to the rough
old farmer’s ideas—and then did the same
by her mother.</p>

<p>‘Good-night, dear, dear mother,’ she
murmured fervently. ‘You’ve been a good
mother to your poor, thoughtless, useless Nell.’</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_227">[Pg 227]</span></p>

<p>‘Ay, that I have,’ replied Mrs Llewellyn,
with the beautiful self-assurance of the
poor, ‘but you’re worth it all the same.’</p>

<p>‘Thank you, dear, God bless you,’ said
Nell gently, as she prepared to leave the
room. At the door she turned and stood
regarding the two old people with her
lovely hazel eyes, as if she could not gaze
enough at them.</p>

<p>‘You’re a rare fool,’ cried her mother
gaily. ‘There, run away to your bed, do,
and get up wiser in the morning.’</p>

<p>And then, as her daughter with a solemn
smile disappeared, she remarked to her
husband,—</p>

<p>‘I’m sometimes half afeared, father, if
that girl ain’t a bit mazed. She do look at
one so queer with them big eyes of hers.
Did you notice her just now?’</p>

<p>‘Not I,’ replied the farmer. ‘I’ve other
things to do besides noticing a maid’s
eyes. So now come along to bed, wife,
and forget all such rubbish, for we’ll have
to be up betimes to make ready to receive
his lordship.’</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_228">[Pg 228]</span></p>

<p>And the old couple went up to their
room, laughing and cackling as they
passed Nell’s door.</p>

<p>And as they did so the clock struck
nine.</p>

<p>She heard it as she stood in her bedroom,
with her hands clasped in front of
her, dazed and bewildered. The world
seemed to have closed on her with her
parents’ good-night kisses—all the people
in it appeared to have become indistinct
and blurred. They were fading away before
her mental vision one by one—the
Earl and his Countess, Jack Portland,
Hugh Owen, her father and mother,
Hetty, everyone. Nell felt she had done
with them all for ever. At one moment
she thought of writing to Hugh Owen.
He had loved her and had great hopes
of her, and she had dashed them all
aside. She was sorry for his disappointment
and his broken faith. Should she
write and tell him so. But what could
she say, except that the man he saw her
with was her former lover, and if he discovered<span class="pagenum" id="Page_229">[Pg 229]</span>
him to be the earl, there would
be another unpleasantness for Ilfracombe.
Oh, no! Her life had been all a muddle
and a mistake, it was best to leave it so.
She could not unravel it, and the more
she touched it the more entangled it became.
Best to remain silent to the last.
Not a thought of Portland entered her
head. She had made a certain compact
with him, and she had meant to end it
like this all along. But she moved across
the room with a soft lingering step, and
eyes that seemed already covered with
the film of death, and gazed from the
window that looked towards the house where
Ilfracombe was sleeping.</p>

<p>‘Good-bye,’ she murmured indistinctly,
‘good-bye.’</p>

<p>And then Nell turned away, and taking
hold of a chair, dragged it to the wardrobe,
and mounting on it took down the
bottle of poison for which her mother had
told her to write a label.</p>

<p class="muchsmaller">“John Strange Winter is never more thoroughly at home than when delineating
the characters of children, and everyone will be delighted with the dignified Madge
and the quaint Pearl. The book is mainly occupied with the love affairs of Terry
(the soldier servant who appears in many of the preceding books), but the children
buzz in and out of its pages much as they would come in and out of a room in real
life, pervading and brightening the house in which they dwell.”—<cite>Leicester Daily Post.</cite></p>

<p class="hanging">THE CONFESSIONS OF A PUBLISHER.</p>

<p class="muchsmaller">“The much discussed question of the relations between a publisher and his clients
furnishes Mr John Strange Winter with material for one of the brightest tales of
the season. Abel Drinkwater’s autobiography is written from a humorous point of
view; yet here, as elsewhere, ‘many a true word is spoken in jest,’ and in the conversations
of the publisher and his too ingenuous son, facts come to light that are
worthy of the attention of aspirants to literary fame.”—<cite>Morning Post.</cite></p>

<p class="hanging">MIGNON’S HUSBAND. <span class="small">(14th Edition.)</span></p>

men and women whose acquaintanceship we can only regret can never blossom
into friendship.”—<cite>Whitehall Review.</cite></p>

truth about it.”—<cite>Vanity Fair.</cite></p>

<p class="hanging">MIGNON’S SECRET. <span class="small">(17th Edition.)</span></p>

<p class="muchsmaller">“This discursive story, dealing with life in a garrison town, is full of pleasant
‘go’ and movement which has distinguished ‘Bootles’ Baby,’ ‘Pluck,’ or, in fact, a
majority of some half-dozen novelettes which the author has submitted to the eyes
of railway bookstall patronisers.”—<cite>Daily Telegraph.</cite></p>

<p class="muchsmaller">“The story which gives its title to this new sheaf of stories by the popular author
of ‘Bootles’ Baby’ is a very touching and pathetic one.... Amongst the other
stories, the one entitled ‘Out of the Mists’ is, perhaps, the best written, although
the tale of true love it embodies comes to a most melancholy ending.”—<cite>County

<p class="muchsmaller">“Nell Fitzgerald is an irreproachable heroine, full of gentle womanliness,
and rich in all virtues that make her kind estimable. Mrs Kennard’s work is
marked by high tone as well as vigorous narrative, and sportsmen, when searching
for something new and beguiling for a wet day or spell of frost, can hardly light
upon anything better than these fresh and picturesque hunting stories of Mrs
